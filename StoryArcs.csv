91,Zero Hour,"Zero Hour was a 1994 comic book miniseries and crossover storyline that ran in DC Comics. In it, the one-time hero Hal Jordan, who had until then been a member of the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps, mad with grief after the destruction of his home town of Coast City, and having obtained immense power as Parallax, attempted to destroy, and then remake, the DC Universe. The crossover involved almost every DC Universe monthly series published at the time. The issues of the series itself were numbered in reverse order, beginning with issue #4 and ending with #0 (i.e. 'counting down to zero'). The series was written and penciled by Dan Jurgens, with inks by Jerry Ordway.   Zero Hour was intended by DC as a belated follow-up to their landmark limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, and was indeed subtitled '(A) Crisis in Time'. It promised to do for the inconsistent future timelines of the DC Universe what Crisis had done for its parallel worlds: unify them into a new one.   The event served as an opportunity to reconcile some of the problems left unaddressed by Crisis and other problems that had been unintentionally caused by it. In particular, the revised characters of the post-Crisis universe had been rolled out gradually, with DC continuing to feature the old versions until the new versions were launched, some of them a year or several after the first wave of same (i.e. Superman: The Man of Steel and Batman: Year One). The character of Hawkman was one of the most problematic, since the revised version didn't first appear until 1989. This raised the question of what version of Hawkman had been seen since 1986. (He had been retconned to be both the Golden Age Hawkman and a Thanagarian spy.) The Legion of Super-Heroes faced similar problems with the elimination of Superboy from DC continuity. (Valor, aka Mon-El, a character with similar powers, had been recast to take his place as the Legion's inspiration and most powerful member.) These and other retcons were not always well received by readers and often introduced new problems.   The apparent villain of the story presented in the miniseries was a character named Extant (see also Hawk), who was using his temporal powers to unravel the DC Universe's timeline. In a confrontation with members of the Justice Society of America, Extant aged several of them (removing the effect that had kept these heroes of the 1940s vital into the 1990s), leaving them either feeble or dead. The true power behind the destruction of the universe - caused by temporal rifts of entropy - turned out to be former Green Lantern Hal Jordan, now calling himself 'Parallax.' Jordan had previously gone insane, and was now trying to remake the universe, undoing the events which had caused his breakdown and his own murderous actions following it. The collective efforts of the other superheroes managed to stop Jordan/Parallax from imposing his vision of a new universe, and the universe was recreated anew, albeit with subtle differences compared to the previous one. This 'blanking out/recreation' of the DC Universe was reflected in many of the tie-in issues; near the end of several of the tie-ins, the world began to disappear, and the last page of the book (or in some cases, several pages) had been left blank.   Hal Jordan, whose descent into villainhood outraged some fans, was later exonerated of his crimes in the 2004-2005 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth, which revealed that Parallax was a separate entity that had possessed Jordan, and was responsible for his murderous actions.   Eventually almost every person seemingly murdered by Hal Jordan/Parallax had returned from the dead or was shown to have somehow survived.   Zero Month books should not be considered part of the Zero Hour crossover.  Zero Hour crossovers only occurred between Showcase '94 #8 and Zero Hour #0.  While Zero Month was spawned from Zero Hour, it is considered a separate entity.     Issues (49)"
