55,Detective Comics,1,March 1937 - October 2011,United States,English,"In one sense, this is the longest-running title in DC's catalog.  It started publication before Action Comics , but has a lower issue count because Action did a short turn as a weekly series.  Furthermore, Detective was published bi-monthly for a period in the 1970's, while Action , except for its short weekly run, has always been a monthly comic. Also, the most famous character of this title, Batman, is younger than the most famous character of Action , Superman, because Batman appears in the title more than two years after the title began.  Superman, by contrast, is in Action #1. Detective Comics gave its name fairly quickly to the organization as a whole.  In 1940, the company that had been started by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, then co-funded (and soon wholly owned by) Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz, started to place a circular logo bearing the initials \'DC\', on all its properties. The series was relaunched in 2011 after issue #881.  The series returned to original numbering with issue #934 in 2016. Detective Comics (1937) #881 continues to Detective Comics (2011) #1 Detective Comics (1938) #934 continues from Detective Comics (2011) #52"

34,Action Comics,1,June 1938 - September 2016,United States,English,"Becomes ACTION COMICS WEEKLY #601-642, then resumes as ACTION COMICS with #643. As Action has been primarily an anthology title for most of its life, please take care not to mistake the title of a story in an issue for the title of the issue as a whole.

50,The Flash,1,June 1987 - February 2009,United States,English,"This title was the post- Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot of the Flash title, starring Wally West in the title role. What's interesting is the way that its actual title changed.  For the first 100 issues the book was simply Flash .  At issue 101, the title changed to The Flash --perhaps a subtle admission by DC that Wally had finally \'grown up\' enough to earn the definite article. The title ended as the events of Infinite Crisis were drawing to a close in March of 2006 with issue #230. Continues as The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive (2006) #1-13, then All Flash (2007) #1, then returns to The Flash in August 2007 as issue #231."
