34,Action Comics,1,June 1938 - September 2016,United States,English,"Becomes ACTION COMICS WEEKLY #601-642, then resumes as ACTION COMICS with #643. As Action has been primarily an anthology title for most of its life, please take care not to mistake the title of a story in an issue for the title of the issue as a whole.

50,The Flash,1,June 1987 - February 2009,United States,English,"This title was the post- Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot of the Flash title, starring Wally West in the title role. What's interesting is the way that its actual title changed.  For the first 100 issues the book was simply Flash .  At issue 101, the title changed to The Flash --perhaps a subtle admission by DC that Wally had finally 'grown up' enough to earn the definite article. The title ended as the events of Infinite Crisis were drawing to a close in March of 2006 with issue #230. |_| |_| Continues as The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive (2006) #1-13, then All Flash (2007) #1, then returns to The Flash in August 2007 as issue #231."
54,Adventure Comics,1,November 1938 - October 2011,United States,English,"One of the longer-running titles in history, Adventure Comics , as it was known throughout most of its history, started life as New Comics .  After 11 issues, it became New Adventure Comics , before finally settling on the name Adventure Comics with issue 32.  It is somewhat unclear why the publisher started the publication as New Comics , because they were anything but.  Truth is, most of the first 11 issues were a repackaging of comics that had already appeared in newspapers.      As the title morphed over those first few years, the level of reprinted material dropped.  Ironically, the 'newest' comics were in Adventure Comics . While the first few years of the title had much more in common with the so-called 'British comic' than the American comic book, the style settled into something modern American audiences would recognize as the years progressed.  After issue 40 in July of 1939, it became the home of the Sandman.  Hourman joined in February of the following year, and the title would carry on with these two in the lead for many issues in the 1940s.  Later, Superboy, and then the Legion of Superheroes, would usurp these 'older' heroes, but the title would remain at least semi-anthological for its entire run.  Though the title tended to enjoy long periods of association with certain characters, it's certainly in the running for longest-running anthological series. As this is an anthological series, titles of individual stories are not issue titles.  The 'issue title' field is being used here to show where the cover title (and in some cases, the indicia as well), significantly changed for a period of several consecutive issues.  The indicia title of issues #479-490 is 'Adventure Comics Presents Dial H for Hero'. The series was digest-sized for issues 491-503. When the series resumed in 2010, it skipped 12 issue numbers to account for the intermediate series Adventure Comics (2009) (even though that series really had 13 issues, including #0)."
55,Detective Comics,1,March 1937 - October 2011,United States,English,"In one sense, this is the longest-running title in DC's catalog.  It started publication before Action Comics , but has a lower issue count because Action did a short turn as a weekly series.  Furthermore, Detective was published bi-monthly for a period in the 1970's, while Action , except for its short weekly run, has always been a monthly comic. Also, the most famous character of this title, Batman, is younger than the most famous character of Action , Superman, because Batman appears in the title more than two years after the title began.  Superman, by contrast, is in Action #1. Detective Comics gave its name fairly quickly to the organization as a whole.  In 1940, the company that had been started by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, then co-funded (and soon wholly owned by) Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz, started to place a circular logo bearing the initials 'DC', on all its properties. The series was relaunched in 2011 after issue #881.  The series returned to original numbering with issue #934 in 2016. Detective Comics (1937) #881 continues to Detective Comics (2011) #1 Detective Comics (1938) #934 continues from Detective Comics (2011) #52"

110,Showcase,1,Mar/Apr 1956 - September 1978,United States,English,"There seems to be some debate over the name of this title.  Is it Showcase Presents or, more simply, Showcase ?  It matters, probably, when you were first introduced to the work.  If you came to it in the early-mid 60s, you might well think of it as Showcase Presents .  But if you have a longer view of the title, you probably think of it as just Showcase .  Early issues were not so regular in the use of the word that came after 'Showcase', at times opting for 'presenting', and, on one or two occasions, opting for no anteceding word at all. A bigger controversy might be over the titling system used in this database.  Because some issues had multiple stories, we've opted to title each issue by the most prominent words on the cover--that is, the characters (or, less frequently, story type) that appeared inside.  Stories, even when there's just one, are listed individually.  This will hopefully give consistency to this deliberately chaotic title. Whatever the naming controversies, though, the importance of Showcase is fairly clear.  The Silver Age's Star-Spangled Comics or All-American Comics this 105-issue run served as a testbed for new characters, and, as such, marks the first appearances of dozens of criminals and heroes.

There were actually a planned 106 issues in this series before the 'DC Implosion'. Issues #105 and #106 were released (black and white only) in the pages of Cancelled Comic Cavalcade (1978) with #105 showcasing Dead Man and #106 showcasing the Creeper."
