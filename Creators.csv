10,James Dale Robinson,"James Dale Robinson, usually referred to as just ""James Robinson"", is a British writer of comic books and screenplays and known for his interest in old collectibles and memorabilia. His most famous work is Starman, where he took a fairly obscure character and revitalized him to considerable critical acclaim. In 1997, Robinson's work on the title garnered him an Eisner Award, for the Best Serialized Story. He is also famous for his comic The Golden Age, which, despite being outside the normal DC universe continuity as an Elseworlds story, still established much of the backstory he would later use in Starman. He has also written the Batman book Legends of the Dark Knight, JSA, Hawkman, and his own creation Leave it to Chance, for which Robinson won two more Eisner Awards in 1997, for Best New Series and Best Title for Younger Readers. In addition to his work in comics, Robinson wrote the screenplay for the 2003 movie version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This caused some controversy among fans of the original work, many of whom were disappointed that an established comics writer's take on Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's series took so many liberties with and considerably changed the tone of the source material.","April 1, 1963","Manchester, England, UK"

1,Warren Ellis,"Warren Ellis (born February 16, 1968) is a British author of comics, novels, and television, well known for his sarcastic personality and sociocultural commentaries, both through his online presence and his writing, as well as his use of extropian and transhumanist themes (most notably nanotechnology, cryonics, uploading, and human enhancement). He is a resident of Southend-on-Sea, England. Ellis was born in Essex in February 1968, about seventeen months before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon on July 20, 1969; he reports that the televised broadcast of the event is his earliest coherent memory. He was a student at The South East Essex Sixth Form College, commonly known as SEEVIC. He contributed comic work to the college magazine, Spike, along with Richard Easter, who also later followed a career in writing. Prior to his career as a writer he had ""done most of the shitty jobs you can imagine; ran a bookstore, ran a pub, worked in bankruptcy, worked in a record shop, lifted compost bags for a living"". Ellis' writing career started in the British independent magazine Deadline with a six page short story in 1990. Other early works include a Judge Dredd short and a Doctor Who one-pager. His first ongoing work, Lazarus Churchyard appeared in Blast!, a short lived British magazine. By 1994 Ellis began working for Marvel Comics, where he took over the series Hellstorm with #12, which he wrote until its cancellation with #21. He also did some work on the Marvel 2099 imprint, most notably in a storyline where a futuristic Doctor Doom took over the United States. His most notable early Marvel work is a run on Excalibur, a superhero series set in Britain. He also wrote a four-issue arc of Thor called ""Worldengine"", in which he dramatically revamped both the character and book. Ellis then started working for DC Comics, Caliber Comics, and Image Comics' Wildstorm studio, where he wrote the Genï¿½ï¿½ spin-off DV8 and took over Stormwatch, a previously action-oriented team book, which he gave a more idea- and character-driven flavor. He wrote issues #37-50 with artist Tom Raney, and the 11 issues of volume two with artist Bryan Hitch. He and Hitch followed that with the Stormwatch spinoff The Authority, a cinematic super-action series for which Ellis coined the term ""widescreen comics."" In 1997 Ellis started Transmetropolitan, a creator-owned series about an acerbic ""gonzo"" journalist in a dystopian future America, co-created with artist Darick Robertson and published by DC's Helix imprint. When Helix was discontinued the following year, Transmetropolitan was shifted to the Vertigo imprint, and remained one of the most successful non-superhero comics DC was then publishing . Transmetropolitan ran for 60 issues (plus a few specials), ending in 2002. It remains Ellis' largest work to date. 1999 saw the launch of Planetary, another Wildstorm series by Ellis and John Cassaday, and Ellis' short run on the DC/Vertigo series Hellblazer. He left that series when DC announced, following the Columbine High School massacre, that it would not publish ""Shoot"", a Hellblazer story about school shootings, although the story had been written and illustrated prior to the Columbine massacre.Planetary was notoriously plagued with delays, but it conclude in 2009 with issue #27. Ellis also returned to Marvel Comics, as part of the company's ""Revolution"" event, to head the ""Counter-X"" line of titles. This project was intended to revitalize the X-Men spinoff books Generation X, X-Man, and X-Force, but it was not successful, and Ellis stayed away from mainstream superhero comics for a time. In 2003 Ellis started Global Frequency, a 12-issue limited series for Wildstorm, and continued to produce work for various publishers, including DC, Avatar Comics, AiT/Planet Lar, Cliffhanger and Homage Comics. In 2004 Ellis came back to mainstream superhero comics. He took over Ultimate Fantastic Four and Iron Man for Marvel under a temporary exclusive work for hire contract. Toward the end of 2004, Ellis released the ""Apparat Singles Group"", which he described as ""An imaginary line of comics singles. Four imaginary first issues of imaginary series from an imaginary line of comics, even."" The Apparat titles were published by Avatar but carried only the Apparat logo on the cover. In 2006 Ellis worked on Jack Cross (for DC), which was not well received and subsequently cancelled. For Marvel, he worked on Nextwave, which lasted 12 issues. The series was critically acclaimed and only ended because Ellis didn't want to carry on with it after twelve issues. He also worked on the Ultimate Galactus trilogy. Ellis also took over the Thunderbolts monthly title, which deals with the aftermath of the Marvel Civil War crossover In honor of the 20th anniversary of Marvel's New Universe in 2006, Ellis and illustrator Salvador Larroca created a new series that re-imagines the New Universe, under the title newuniversal. The first issue was released on December 6, 2006. Ellis continues to work on several projects for different publishers, including Fell (for Image), Desolation Jones (for DC/Wildstorm), , Blackgas (for Avatar Comics). Ellis also wrote an episode of Justice League Unlimited entitled ""Dark Heart"". Ellis has managed a series of online forums and media to promote his written works and his creative ideals. These forums are sharply moderated by Ellis and his assistants, to suit the particular purpose each one was created for. They include the Warren Ellis Forum, DiePunyHumans.com, the Bad Signal mailing list, WarrenEllis.com, Warren-Ellis.livejournal.com and The-Engine.net. He is popularly known as ""Stalin,"" ""The Love Swami,"" or ""Internet Jesus"" on these forums. Ellis' first prose novel, Crooked Little Vein, was published in the summer of 2007 by William Morrow (an imprint of HarperCollins), with a second novel, Listener, to follow. He is also developing a television series for AMC called Dead Channel, for which he will be the sole writer. It has recently been announced that he is writing an animated direct to DVD feature film, Castlevania: Dracula's Curse, which will be based on the similarly titled video game Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. Ellis has described himself as ""a notorious pain in the arse for getting involved in book design"" According to a comment made in the first issue of Fell, he has more trade paperbacks in print than anyone else in the American comic industry. Ellis is currently writing a column for the Suicide Girls website that appears every Sunday, entitled ""The Sunday Hangover."" Ellis is also writing a Second Life column for Reuters titled Second Life Sketches In Second Life he's known under the name Integral Danton. On July 29th 2007 Ellis announced two new projects for Avatar press; FreakAngels, a free long-form webcomic illustrated by Paul Duffield, and Ignition City, an ongoing monthly series.","Feb. 16,1968",

22,Steve Yeowell,"Having trained in 3D design (specialising in silversmithing and jewellery), Yeowell began drawing comics purely for pleasure, with no particular intention to become a professional artist. Having shown his portfolio to artist Bryan Talbot, he quickly found himself given work by Swiftsure (on the Lieutenant Fl'ff strip), Action Force, ThunderCats and Zoids comics. This last put him in touch with writer Grant Morrison, who then picked Yeowell to be the sole artist on new superhero strip Zenith, to run in 2000 AD beginning in 1987. Zenith was a popular success, running to four full-length series plus many one-offs. Yeowell was headhunted by American comics companies and has worked on Batman, The Fantastic Four, The Invisibles,[1] JSA and Starman. He continued his association with Morrison, collaborating on Sebastian O and The New Adventures of Hitler. Yeowell's work is noted for delicate penmanship and lifelike facial expressions, with a notable economy of style that means that his work suits both colour and monochrome treatment. He works with a dip pen (Gillot 404 nib) and a Windsor & Newton Series 7 No.3 sable brush, as well as Rotring and marker pens, on 220 g/m² Daler Rowney Heavyweight Cartridge Paper. The concentration on human features means that Yeowell's work is held to suit superhero, science fiction and historical genres equally. Recent work has included The Red Seas, an eighteenth-century pirate story scripted by Ian Edginton and science fiction Triad tale Red Fang by Steve Moore.",,
