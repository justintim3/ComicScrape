3534,Grim Reaper (Marvel),Eric Williams ,3534_20070125132301_char.jpg,"As a zombie, he had unnatural strength and endurance, and was largely oblivious to pain and injury; he maintained his undead existence by draining the life forces of others through his scythe. After empowerment by Lloigoroth and Blackheart, the Reaper could perform illusion casting, shape-shifting, energy blasts, teleportation, inter-dimensional travel, conjuring/commanding minor demonic creatures, matter restructuring, remote communication, remote surveillance, transmutation, emotion vampirism (feeding off the despair of others) and reanimating the dead as his zombie servants.",,"Supposedly born bad, Eric Williams always defined himself by comparison to his 'good' brother, Simon. Both brothers struggled in vain for the approval of their demanding, abusive father, Sanford; but where Simon was shy and studious, Eric was athletic, wild and reckless. Regarded as the black sheep of the family, Eric became a thief and tried unsuccessfully to pressure Simon into participating in his petty crimes. Secretly admiring Simon's virtue, Eric developed an unrealistically idealized view of his brother, whom he loved and resented in equal measure. Scorning his family's high-tech manufacturing business, Eric became a gambler and a professional criminal, rising within the ranks of the Maggia organized crime cartel. Simon, meanwhile, dutifully entered the family business and took over its management after Sanford's death. Williams Innovations gradually failed, thanks in part to stiff competition from rival firm Stark Industries, and a desperate Simon turned to Eric for help-though Eric's attempted intimidation and coercion of business rivals and potential clients failed to produce useful results. As a last resort, Simon stole money from his own company, hoping to invest it in Eric's Maggia ventures for a fast profit and save the business; but Simon got caught, and was arrested for embezzlement. Unable to accept his brother's fall from grace, Eric lied to his mother and others by claiming that he was the real embezzler, insisting that Simon had merely taken the blame. |||| |||| Simon was transformed into Wonder Man by Baron Heinrich Zemo and used against the Avengers before sacrificing himself to save the heroes, who preserved a copy of his brain patterns in the hope of resurrecting him someday. Learning of Simon's apparent demise, Eric went mad with grief and wrongly blamed the Avengers for Simon's death. He hired the Tinkerer to build him a high-tech miniature arsenal in the form of a scythe, enhancing it with a coma-inducing device created by the mad robot Ultron, a fellow Avengers enemy who became so intrigued by Eric's family-inspired vendetta that he secured a copy of Simon's brain patterns for experimental purposes, later using them to create the android Vision. As the Grim Reaper, Eric very nearly killed the Avengers but was thwarted by the Black Panther. Escaping, the Reaper recruited fellow Avengers foes Living Laser, Man-Ape (M'Baku), Power Man (Erik Josten) and Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne) into the Lethal Legion, whose members competed with each other to see who could capture or kill the most Avengers; but the Legion was soon defeated and imprisoned, thanks largely to a new Avengers recruit, the Vision, whom the Reaper could not bring himself to kill. |||| |||| Stealing and preserving Simon's body, the Reaper offered to transfer Vision's mind into it and make him human in exchange for not opposing Reaper's efforts to destroy the Avengers, though Vision refused. Later, in partnership with a Space Phantom and unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, the Reaper seized control of a faction of the subversive group Hydra and conspired against the Avengers, again tempting Vision with offers of a human body, at one point promising to seize the body of Captain America for this purpose. Vision played along to infiltrate the Reaper's plans but ultimately helped the Avengers defeat the villains, though the Reaper and Vision saved each other's lives in turn during the fight. Captured and imprisoned, Eric eventually escaped and recovered Simon's body, which had actually been in a death-like stasis for years while he mutated into a new form. Once Simon was revived (apparently with the aid of Ultron), the Reaper hired the voodoo master Black Talon (Sam Barone) to send the half-dead hero after the Avengers in a zombie-like state, though Simon soon regained full consciousness and took up residence with the Avengers. Aided in penetrating Avengers security by Ultron, the Reaper imprisoned Vision, Wonder Man and several Avengers, staging a mock trial to determine whether the mutated Wonder Man or the android Vision was truly the real Simon Williams. The Reaper decided in favor of Simon and would have killed Vision, but he was defeated by Wonder Man. |||| |||| Deciding that Wonder Man and Vision were both inhuman mockeries of the true Simon, the Reaper tried unsuccessfully to kill them before enlisting his new lover Nekra and old allies Ultron, Black Talon, Goliath (Josten) and Man-Ape in a bizarre scheme to destroy the Avengers and re-create the 'real' Simon Williams by transferring portions of the minds of Vision and Wonder Man into the voodoo-animated corpse of criminal Brady Kent, which had been surgically altered to duplicate Simon's original human form. The plan failed and the Reaper-having belatedly realized that Vision and Wonder Man were truly his brothers-fell to his death while fleeing in shame. Nekra revived Eric as an unwitting, unusually lifelike zombie, teaming with him and the Brady Kent zombie to assault the hospital where Vision's wife Scarlet Witch was giving birth; but the Reaper fell dead when he broke Nekra's spell by discovering, to his horror, that he was a zombie. A Grim Reaper soon fought the Avengers as part of Immortus's Legion of the Unliving, but whether that was the true Eric Williams or not is unclear. Later, Nekra raised the Reaper again, this time as a zombie who could sustain his existence by draining others' life force with his scythe, an ability he tested by fatally stabbing Nekra. He renewed his partnership with Ultron, but did so in order to subvert Ultron's plans to 'robotize' humanity since this scheme would have deprived the Reaper of human victims; in the end, both villains were captured by the Avengers. Shortly thereafter, the Red Skull used both Reaper and Ultron as part of his mind-controlled army of super-villains in a world conquest scheme involving a giant laser cannon, but the Avengers thwarted this plot. |||| |||| Gaining power from the demonic Old Ones' Lloigoroth, the Reaper caused an airliner crash and captured a commuter train, transforming some of his victims into superhuman zombie facsimiles of deceased Avengers foes, apparently imbuing them with the originals' spirits. Reaper's Legion of the Unliving nearly destroyed the Avengers, but his hold over the zombies broke when Vision forced Eric to admit that he had killed himself and the Avengers were not to blame. The Reaper was seemingly consumed by Lloigoroth for his failure. Later, the Reaper appeared to haunt Simon again as part of a baffling conflict staged by the demons Mephisto and Blackheart, though how much (if any) of this encounter was real remains unclear. When Wonder Man died again and mystically returned in a ghostly state, the barriers between life and death weakened enough for Grim Reaper's spirit to return to the earthly plane, mystically enslaving the spirits of Wonder Man and several other dead Avengers to attack the living Avengers. However, the undead Avengers were freed from the Reaper's control by the Scarlet Witch and turned on the Reaper, helping the living Avengers defeat him. In the end, most of the undead Avengers returned to their respective afterlives, but Wonder Man was fully resurrected through the Witch's magic, which also restored the Grim Reaper to life after he was forced to admit his love for his brother. |||| |||| Since his rebirth, the Reaper has apparently decided to abandon his old obsessions. He has even fought alongside the Avengers twice, aiding them against their common enemies Ultron and Alkhema; however, the Reaper remains a ruthless criminal and has renewed his association with the Maggia, renewing his enmity with the Avengers in the process."

4749,Aleta (Marvel),Aleta Ogord ,4749_20070423181422_char.jpg,"Aleta can create focus photons into solid light constructs (such as battering rams, bubbles, ramps, etc.). She can fly by standing on a disc of her solid light and mentally commanding it to rise upwards. Later she was shown to create more complicated constructions and manipulate them (moving and changing size) which appeared to be a power similar to DC Universe character Green Lantern. She was able to lift things weighting up to 50 tons, as well as increased stamina, durability and agility that are common among Arcturans, When she became Starhawk, Aleta gained the ability to fly at speeds approaching that of light, was able to survive in the vacuum of space, control various forms of energy to fire concussive blasts or create protective shields, and displayed limited precognition. She is able to phase through solid matter by aligning her own molecules in a corresponding pattern to the molecules of the object she is attempting to pass through.",,"Aleta Ogord, an Arcturan, was trained to be aggressive and resented her weak and intellectual adoptive brother Stakar. When she was physically merged with Stakar, such that only one of them could exist physically at any one time, she spent much time suspended in limbo. She grew passive and, in time, fell in love with Stakar. The Hawk God allowed the two to separate for a time, and she gave birth to three children, Tara, Sita, and John. |||| |||| Aleta's father, Ogord, sought revenge on Starhawk for abandoning him, kidnapped his grandchildren, and turned them into psychic vampires. The children were killed, and Aleta held it against Stakar for the rest of his life, as she felt he could have prevented it. |||| |||| Eventually, Aleta and Starhawk were separated, and she began a relationship with Vance Astro until a dying Starhawk reabsorbed her to save his own life. For a time, the merged being existed only in Stakar's newly darkened form, even when Aleta was in control, until Aleta finally overpowered Stakar, sent him back to his infant body in the past, and assumed the mantle of Starhawk. She held the title for a brief period, until Stakar returned during a visit to another timeline, after which she gave up the title and powers of Starhawk to be rid of Stakar's influence, which had made her cold and unfeeling. Alhtough she was still in love with Vance and was engaged to marry him, the series ended leaving the future of their relationship ambiguous."

When subjected to tests at Armbruster International to make her beautiful, she also developed super powers, most formidable of which was her 'swan song', a sonic wave which could cause massive devastation.  At first she worked for Hank Armbruster, but she eventually realised that he was exploiting her and turned against him."
648,Thunderball (Marvel),Dr. Eliot Franklin ,648_20070907020610_char.jpg,"Thunderball shares the Asgardian enchantment originally given to the Wrecker, becoming transformed into a being of superhuman power, slightly less than an Asgardian god. He possesses vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins.",,"Dr. Eliot Franklin was a genius-level physicist, nearly on par with Bruce Banner. He even designed a miniature gamma-ray bomb, a feat that eluded Banner. However, his invention was stolen by an unscrupulous executive at Richmond Enterprises, and Franklin was imprisoned after an attempt to steal it back. While in prison at Ryker’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Henry Camp and Brian Calusky, the group managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Camp became Bulldozer, Calusky became Piledriver, and Franklin became Thunderball. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| Thunderball initiated their first foray into crime, destroying anything associated with Richmond Enterprises in order to capture his gamma bomb and ransom New York. They were stopped by the Defenders, but Thunderball and the Wrecking Crew were never contained for long. |||| |||| But Thunderball had always felt superior to his teammates, knowing his intelligence set him apart. He often parted company with them, and was seen acting independently on several occasions. Once, he sought out his ex-girlfriend, Rhonda Taddington, holding her friend, Clytemnestra Erwin, hostage and running into conflict with her boyfriend, Rhodes, James as Iron Man. He later took it upon himself to retrieve the Wrecking Crew’s weapons from the authorities, running afoul of Spider-Man, who defeated Thunderball by overloading his wrecking ball with electricity and knocking him out. |||| |||| However, if the Wrecking Crew appeared, Thunderball was sure to be seen as well, including in their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and Thunderball was left powerless. |||| |||| When imprisoned in the Vault, Thunderball participated in a massive breakout but refused to follow the orders of Venom, battling him over the alliances among their cellmates. However, they were trapped inside with a nuclear reactor that threatened to meltdown, and Thunderball was instrumental in defusing the device with Iron Man. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Thunderball was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although Thunderball grew dissatisfied with the Wrecker’s leadership, coveting all the power of the Crew for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, Thunderball was broken out of prison by Midnight on behalf of the Secret Empire. He served alongside Midnight as their agent, coming into conflict with Midnight’s former mentor, Moon Knight as well as Spider-Man and other heroes, until Midnight was betrayed by the organization and destroyed their headquarters. |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew’s powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. The entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew appeared together for various endeavors: hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan Le Fay, among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the Raft, they joined the massive breakout and escaped."

3256,Giant-Man (Marvel)(Ultimate)(01 - Hank Pym),Henry Pym ,3256_20080709133244_char.jpg,Giant Man can grow into many times his normal size.,,"In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Henry 'Hank' Pym is a brilliant, but mentally fragile scientist who takes Prozac and is married to Janet Pym, née van Dyne. He is chosen to work on the 'Super Soldier Project' for S.H.I.E.L.D. under Nick Fury. Hank is also the superhero 'Giant-Man', able to grow to 59 feet and 11 inches (60 feet being the point where the human body cannot support its own mass). He gains his powers after experimenting on the blood of his wife Jan, who is a mutant. |||| |||| In this continuity, he is prone to domestic violence, a spin off of a storyline in traditional Marvel continuity. He has been attempting to change, going on a medication, and Jan believes that joining the Ultimates could be a new start for them. But the tensions of losing and humiliating himself in a battle with the Hulk, and his jealousy of Jan's 'friendship' with Captain America, lead to a heated argument between the couple that ends after they have a violent fight, and Janet is hospitalized. Captain America himself takes revenge, beats him to a pulp despite the fact that Pym was giant-sized at the time, and forces him out of the team. |||| |||| He is eventually allowed back into the Triskelion, but not as a member of the Ultimates; instead, he serves with the staff and acts as a psychiatrist for inmates, including Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, Maxwell Dillon, Flint Marko and Sergei Kravinoff. |||| |||| Henry seems to overcome his violent streak and becomes desperate to get in the Ultimates again, becoming the ant-manipulator 'Ant-Man' and building two prototype androids, Ultron and Vision II. Despite this, he remains a pariah, becoming increasingly depressed as S.H.I.E.L.D. debuted an entire team of Giant-Men who are capable of breaking the 60-foot 'limit' that he had been unable to overcome and making Hank's place obsolete. Desperate, he joins the vigilante team Defenders, starting a meaningless affair with Valkyrie and making a laughing stock of himself. |||| |||| In spite of his sad descent, he is able to relate to his estranged wife Jan again, and the two begin to see each other again (though their renewed relationship has been platonic so far). On a side note, he is visited by the traitor within the Ultimates — an object of great fan speculation, as of 2005 — but seems too much in a funk to seriously care (It is revealed in Ultimates 2 #9 that the traitor was Ultimate Black Widow). In recently published materials, it has been revealed that Pym is building an army of Ultrons for the invading Coalition. Hank Pym keeps the American populace in line using the Ultron robots he created, not knowing how full scale the attack will prove to be. |||| |||| As the tide of the battle starts to turn to the Ultimates favor, Hank orders the Ultron robots to help The Ultimates and they start taking out The Liberators armed guards. He swears to Quicksilver that he planned on infiltrating The Liberators from the start. Although he appears to be lying, at some point earlier he did give the Wasp a growth serum. Interestingly, when she uses it, she grows taller than Giant-Man ever did, to nearly the same size as the S.H.I.E.L.D. Giant-Men. Apparently Pym finally overcame the 60-foot limit that plagued him earlier in the series. |||| |||| As the Liberators are killed or arrested, Pym once again tries to convince the Ultimates he was on their side the entire time, but Captain America and even Thor don't want to hear it. As the series comes to a close, Jan visits him in the cell Thor and Hulk had occupied eariler, quipping 'So, do we all have spend a little time in these cells?' |||| |||| It has been suggested that this version of Hank suffers from bipolar disorder, which would explain his mood swings between manic/creative highs and depressive/violent lows. His use of Prozac seems to bear this out, as this drug is often prescribed to sufferers."

This often leads to Zatanna being gagged to prevent her from vocalizing a spell. However, even when she was shot in the throat by the Joker and unable to speak, she was able to write a healing spell with her own blood and cast it that way, proving that preventing her from speaking is not absolute proof against her magic.",None entered.

2480,Absorbing Man (Marvel),Carl 'Crusher' Creel ,2480_20051203101616_char.jpg,"* Berserker Strength |||| * Chemical Absorbtion |||| * Energy Absorption (with his ball and chain he took on the same power as for eg.Thor's Uru hammer as soon they came close) |||| * Immortal |||| * Invulnerability |||| * Matter Absorption |||| * Super Strength |||| * Unarmed Combat |||| |||| Creel has the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touches. For example, if Creel were to touch and hold a piece of titanium steel, the tissues of his body would take on the appearance and properties of titanium. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech regardless of the material he absorbs. The more dense, or durable, the material he absorbs, the stronger Creel is; were Creel to touch a high grade steel structure his strength would be roughly equal to that of the Thing. Creel also has the ability to absorb the same level of physical strength as the character he is touching. This power requires Creel's deliberate concentration, although he has a tendency to accidentally absorb materials he did not intend to. Creel's body can also absorb the properties of great amounts of energy in the same fashion it absorbs the properties of solid materials. Creel has proven able to absorb the mystical energies of Thor's enchanted Uru hammer on multiple occasions. |||| |||| The ball and chain that he carries is also mystically enchanted, and this power is extended to it. It is essentially an extension of his own body mass at this point. If the Absorbing Man's body is shattered, he has the ability to completely reconstitute his bodily mass without injury to himself, though it may take a great deal of time to do so. |||| |||| The greatest limitation of the Absorbing Man's powers is his intellect; the Absorbing Man is noticeably unintelligent. |||| |||| It was shown in a Hulk story that Creel developed the power of absorbing the minds of other people, and possessing their bodies. In that particular story, he was shown unusually smart and cunning. Whether this new power will be retconned or become a permanent addition is not certain yet.",,"Mainly an antagonist of Thor, The Absorbing Man was given an enchanted potion by the Norse god Loki which, once ingested, gave him the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touched. Loki thought he was a perfect subject because he is brutal, savage, consumed with hatred for society. Thus, if he touched a steel wall, his whole body could become as hard as steel, while he could still move, think and speak; his strength also increased to the extent that he could battle such immensely strong heroes of the Marvel pantheon as Thor and the Hulk. If his body is damaged or shattered while in a non-organic form, he can reconstitute his body, although this takes a great deal of time and effort. |||| |||| He was in prison at the time of this power transfer, and the heavy ball and chain to which he was attached also magically gained the power. He therefore continued to carry the chain as a kind of mace. |||| |||| His main weaknesses are his low intelligence, making him relatively easy to outwit, and his power can be turned against him if he is tricked or forced into physical contact with a substance with an undesirably low strength. For instance, when fighting the Hulk once, he made the mistake of breaking glass above him, causing shards to fall on him. When he made contact with a shard, his body turned to glass and the Hulk instantly took advantage of this by punching and shattering his foe. |||| |||| Creel has absorbed the properties of a number of unusual or unique substances over the course of his criminal career, including adamantium, Captain America's shield, and Quasar's Quantum Bands. He also is known in the comics for transforming into water (One example is when he battled the Eric Masterson Thor in The Mighty Thor #436). |||| |||| Although Creel is a thug and a villain, he is not wholly heartless, and usually tries to avoid killing innocent bystanders (although he has no qualms about threatening or incapacitating them). In later years, he became romantically involved with fellow supervillain Titania (Mary 'Skeeter' McPherran) and the two were eventually married. |||| |||| The Absorbing Man is highly addicted to narcotics, especially pain killers and cocaine. When he is need of a high he has demonstrated no concern for the safety of others and will work for whatever criminal can supply him with narcotics. Recently, he was tricked into transforming into cocaine and minions operating powerful industrial fans scattered his body in the room he was occupying. His body mass was then collected off of the surfaces and placed into several bags. This all was the doing of The Owl who plans to sell this 'Creel cocaine', but after being used as a drug all over New York (all those who used the drug transformed into anything they came in contact with, just like Creel), Creel managed to reform himself but was defeated by Spider-Man and The Avengers."

Eons ago, the Eternians learned to control aging and eliminate natural death. To prevent overpopulation, the Eternian government sanctioned interstellar warfare and conquest which regularly claimed the lives of multitudes. When enemies could not be found to wage war against, the government held gladiatorial spectacles called The Games. Grom was a naturally skilled gladiator who earned in combat title Champion of Champions. Soon after Grom’s coronation, the Eternians discovered Gigantus, a huge planet on which dwelled an equally advanced but peaceful civilization. Immediately they launched an attack upon the world. Because Gigantus was several hundred times larger than Eternus (about the size of Jupiter), the war became very costly and difficult for the Eternians to sustain. Finally it was decided to simply obliterate the planet. The Eternians showered Gigantus with immensely powerful nuclear warheads and detonated them, destroying the planet. A huge armada of Gigantians, however, who had learned the ways of war after eons of peace, escaped the world’s destruction and attacked Eternus in retaliation. |||| |||| |||| Unprepared for so devastating an attack, the Eternian defenses fell. Government leaders realized that their race faced total extinction. Desperately Eternian scientists prepared to transform Grom, the race’s most outstanding physical specimen, into the receptacle of the collective consciousness and mental might of Eternus. As the surviving population of Eternus marched into huge “synthesizing chambers” scattered across the planet, their organic brains were converted to pure mental energy and projected into Grom. When the process was complete, and only the scientists who conducted the process were left alive, the capsule containing Grom was launched into space to incubate until the being learned to control the powers of his group mind. Eons passed. Then Grom emerged as the Overmind, a warrior who possessed the collective psionic power of the billion brains and who carried in his memory the subliminal command to subdue the universe. |||| |||| The Overmind attacked the first inhabited planet he came upon, the Earth, but was defeated by the Fantastic Four with the aid of the Stranger. The Stranger claimed to be the embodiment of the collective psionic power of all the surviving Gigantians. The Stranger’s psionic abilities proved to be more powerful than those of the Overmind and he shrunk the Overmind to microscopic stature and exiled him to a mote of dust. |||| Several years later, a demonic creature called Null the Living Darkness located Overmind and decided to use him as a pawn in his scheme of conquest. However, when he restored the Eternian to his original power and stature, Null accidentally transported the Overmind to an alternative Earth other than the one upon which he had met his defeat. This Earth was the home of the Squadron Supreme. Null and the Overmind battled the Squadron, who sent for reinforcements in the persons of the Defenders. A being composed of the psychic union of six of the alternate Earth’s most powerful telepaths also aided in the struggle, and were instrumental in neutralizing Null and the Overmind. At the battle’s end, the Overmind’s Eternian consciousness was driven out of its body and the six telepaths, lacking physical bodies, took refuge inside him. Now possessing a benevolent mind and a small fraction of his former mental might, the Overmind returned with the Defenders to their world. After parting company with the group, he set forth for parts unknown."

He was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister, Lilandra, Electron was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Electron was one of a small contingent of Guardsmen that were dispatched by then-Empress Lilandra to retrieve both the famous Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell as well as the powerful device known as the Omni-Wave-Projector. These devices were needed to create the Nega-Bomb - the weapon that ended the war by killing 90% of the Kree population. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Electron, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. ||||"

Seven extraterrestrial predators had come to Earth and slaughtered thousands of humans by feeding on their spinal fluids. On the run in New Orleans, Courtney was kidnapped by a cult that sacrificed her to two of these insatiable parasites, knows as Pritor and Lissik. But Courtney did not die. Instead, the parasites' bites unleashed the Animus, a sentient-energy creature that can absorb the spirit essences of the living and the dead, which was now able to enter the world through Courtney. She became the embodiment of mankind's rage and masculine drive, and quickly developed awesome physical powers of her own. As Anima, Courtney sought revenge against the cult. She also met the Teen Titans and battled a variety of supernatural menaces. Anima remains a wanderer, traveling from place to place and helping those in need by calling upon the fearsome primal force inside her. |||| |||| Anima featured prominently in DC Comics' Bloodbath limited series (1993), in which all the New Blood characters teamed up to help defeat the alien parasites who had empowered them. The following year she showed up in the Zero Hour crossover. |||| |||| Anima's own title, beginning December 1993, ran for 16 months before being canceled due to low sales (issues numbered 1-15, plus a #0 issue between #6 & #7 in line with Zero Hour). It was an unconventional DC comic book, with the main theme being a war between metaphysical beings who embodied the Jungian archetypes of human psychology - Animus was only one of these. The series had a huge supporting cast, both human and supernatural - in some issues, Anima herself appeared for only a few pages. Courtney's younger brother Jeremy Mason becomes the channel for Animus' evil sister, Eris (Eris shares her name with a goddess of Greek Mythology, who herself appeared in DC's Wonder Woman title, second series). Animus and Eris ultimately combine as the Syzygy, to fight their father/enemy known only as The Nameless One. The series featured innumerable pop-culture references, as symbols of the collective unconscious where the archetypal beings dwell. Fellow DC superheroes Superboy and Hawkman also guest-starred - with Superboy temporarily acting as a channel for an archetype called The Warrior. |||| |||| Since the demise of her title, Anima seems to have been virtually forgotten by DC and has appeared only once or twice, most recently in the final issue of Infinite Crisis. |||| |||| Later, Cyborg recruited Anima into a new team of Teen Titans."

Hercules' strength is well in excess of the 'Class 100' Level (able to lift/press in excess of 100 tons), making him, one of the strongest beings in the Marvel universe. Hercules has highly developed leg muscles, although they do not match those of the Hulk. Hercules can make a standing high jump of at least 100 feet in Earth's gravity. |||| Hercules is also an Olympian thereby being an immortal, and as true immortals, the Olympian gods do not age and are not susceptible to disease. Although they can be wounded in battle, they cannot die by any conventional means, and have a rapid healing rate. Hercules has a greater resistance to physical injury than any other Olympian god except for Zeus, and possibly Neptune and Pluto. Hercules is virtually tireless. His supernaturally enhanced musculature produces no fatigue poisons. He can even survive unprotected in the vacuum of space for a brief period of time. Only an injury of such magnititude that it incinerated him or dispersed a major portion of his bodily molecules could kill Hercules. In at least some such cases, Zeus or one of the other gods might still be able to resurrect him.",,"Hercules is the son of Zeus, king of the gods of Olympus, and Alcmena, a mortal woman who lived about three thousand years ago. Recognizing the need for a son who would be powerful enough to defend both the Olympian gods and humanity from future dangers he foresaw, Zeus seduced Alcmena in the guise of her husband, King Amphitryon of Troezen. Thanks to Zeus's enchantment, Hercules was born with the potential for extraordinary strength, which he first displayed before he was even one year old by strangling two serpents which attacked him. As an adult, Hercules is best known for his celebrated Twelve Labors, which were performed in part to prove his worthiness for immortality to Zeus. (One of these Labors, the cleansing of the Aegean Stables, was actually performed by the Eternal called the Forgotten One, who was sometimes mistaken for Hercules.) |||| |||| In the course of these Labors, Hercules provoked the wrath of three immortals who remain his enemies to this day. By slaughtering the man-eating Stymphalian Birds, he enraged the war god Ares, to whom they were sacred. In temporarily capturing Cerberus, the three-headed hound that serves as guardian to the Olympian underworld (not to be confused with the shape-shifting giant of the same name), Hercules offended Pluto, the lord of that realm. By killing the Nemean Lion, the Hydra, and other creatures spawned by the inconceivably grotesque and powerful monster Typhoeus, Hercules gained the bitter enmity of Typhon, the immortal humanoid offspring of Typhoeus and a Titaness. |||| |||| However, it was the centaur Nessus who caused Hercules's mortal demise. Nessus kidnapped Hercules's wife Deianeira, whereupon Hercules shot him with an arrow. Feigning a wish to make amends, the dying centaur told Deianeira how to make a love charm from his allegedly enchanted blood, aware that it was now tainted with the lethal poison of the Hydra, in which Hercules had dipped his arrows. Some time after Nessus's death, Deianeira, distraught over her husband's latest infidelity, rubbed the supposed love charm into Hercules's shirt. When Hercules's donned the shirt, the poison quickly worked and caused Hercules great pain. In an attempt to end this pain, he built a funeral pyre for himself and set it ablaze. Zeus intervened however, consuming the pyre with his thunderbolts and bringing Hercules to Olympus to be made a true immortal. |||| In an alternate future of the 23rd century, Hercules is the sole survivor of the Olympians, after Zeus had decided that the time had come for them to leave this plane of existence. Hercules then left Olympus to become the father to a new race of gods."

Kent was well known and followed around by the notable reporter Lois Lane who tracked his space farring exploits until he was lost on one of his space travels. He would later marry Lane who was revealed to be the super powered Amazon, Super-Woman. |||| |||| Kent was supposedly saved from a fiery death on his crashing space shuttle by benevolent aliens who reformed his body into the powerhouse that it now is. Later history states that Kent was kidnapped by an unspecified groups of aliens who had encountered Kent and decided to use the expendable Kent as a test animal for their weapons program. Kent was converted into a living power converter using Anti-Kryptonite as the base source. The aliens had succeeded in their plans of creating a living weapon, far exceeding their expected power levels. |||| |||| Unfortunately for the aliens, before Kent could be controlled after being powered, Kent mastered his emerging talents and killed his captors. The now superpowered Kent returned to Earth where he began his reign as superpowered Ultraman and began a life of conquerance of his home Earth. |||| |||| As Ultraman, Kent would inspire other powered beings to follow in his wake where they would form the Crime Syndicate and begin the process of ruling their planet. |||| |||| At some point, Ultraman came to encounter an Ultra-Dog called Neutro, which for some reason he put to sleep. |||| |||| It would be the result of Ultraman and his ruthless domination of their native dimension Earth that would cause that reality's Lex Luthor to rise up to protect his world from the repression of Ultraman and his associates in the Crime Syndicate of Amerika. Luthor's plan would result in the first cross Earth meeting where the Crime Syndicate would engage in battle against the Justice League before they were returned to the their Earth for fear of losing their home base to the social attitudes of those native to the Justice League's Earth. |||| |||| Luthor's plan initially failed to defeat the Crime Syndicate as his entire world basically accepts the Crime Syndicate as a legitimate entity. But Luthor succeeded in gathering new powered beings to oppose the Crime Syndicate. Most of these beings would reflect the criminal populace of the Justice League such as Sir Solomon Grundy and others. |||| |||| Arriving to Superman's Fortress through the Anti-Phantom Zone, Ultraman, alongside Owlman and Superwoman, were behind the Super-Baby under Superman's protection with the intention of killing him, but when the infant was finally in their possession they discovered it was no ordinary child. |||| |||| The baby revealed itself to be the antimatter Brainiac who became ultrapowerful by fusing with Ultraman's DNA. Planning to destroy both matter and antimatter worlds, Owlman used a bluff to scare Brainiac saying he had the means to destroy Ultraman and anyone with his power, greatly enraging the ultravillian. With Brainiac murdered by his wife, Ultraman and his allies returned to their world. |||| |||| JLA VS CSA |||| Ultraman's Crime Syndicate was once again the dominating force on their world with little to no opposition from anyone, suffering once again from boredom. Luckily for them, Power Ring found a place on their universe were they could find powerful beings to fight and kill, none other than Qward itself. Devastating the planet just for fun, the Syndicate battles until a mysterious event of sorts reshapes reality somehow, reversing time as well. Investigating the nature off the cataclysm, the Syndicate discovers that it was a matter-based wave, so they decide to invade the Earth of the League undercover, swapping their places with their matter counterparts and disguising like them. |||| |||| Trying to get information posing as Superman, Ultraman was having trouble as virtually no one was afraid of him, thus nobody had an inherent desire to obey him. That, plus the people's admiration over Superman caused Ultraman to finally lose it. Encountering and clashing against Superman, Ultraman nearly defeated the Kryptonian and joined his allies on their battle, easily overpowering the League and forcing them to flee, leaving the world for them to take. |||| |||| Deciding to stay, Ultraman and his Syndicate captured slaves in order to build a citadel, thus the League banded a group of reinforcements which successfully repelled the Syndicate and drove them to abandon Earth to look for the Justice League. Watching how the Qwardians destroy the League, the Syndicate was planning on letting them kill each other and take down the one left standing. But their fun was short as the Qwardians redirected their wrath against them and their world, forcing them to return there. Unable to defeat the Qwardians, the League was willing to help them if they asked them too, and besides Ultraman's objection, Superwoman asked them the favor, now owing them. After their victory over the Qwardians, Owlman sent the League back to their world and discovered that theirs was now full of chaos, with all their world rebelling against them. |||| |||| Some time after Qward's invasion, the Crime Syndicate begun a massive abduction of the several Earths' populace in order to gain slaves to rebuild their own wounded world. After the Justice League arrived to the antimatter Earth, the Syndicate arrived and confronted them with a hostage. Welcoming them, Ultraman told the League that they were willing to peacefully deal with them since they owe them a favor, but besides their newfound 'respect', they still went to the point of threatening the life of their hostage if they didn't comply to their demands, thus forcing Superman to accept the deal. |||| |||| Waiting for the League on their agreed meeting place, Ultraman and his Syndicate saw Superman arriving alone. When offering to release the people from their world to return the favor, Superman enraged to the offer of saving only their world and fought them all at once. Overwhelming Superman, the League arrived to support but they too were expected by the Syndicate who managed to turn the battle on their favor. However, Superman's gaining control over his senses gave him the skill he needed to overwhelm his foes and trap them on their own dimensional trap. Confined by Superwoman's Lasso, Ultraman revealed his enemies the true nature of their device before Superman activated it to banish him, Superwoman and Owlman to the interdimensiomal void. |||| |||| Ultraman and his allies were eventually set free and returned to their home Earth. |||| |||| Unknown to them, Alexander Luthor planted a matter-bomb on their world that would trigger in order to caught the Crime Syndicate off-guard with no way to defend themselves against it. Unable to stop the spreading destruction, the matter wave destroyed a quarter of their world before they could find a way to transport it to another world. |||| |||| Allowing the wave to consume that world, the Syndicate followed its last survivor, Green Lantern, to New Earth. |||| |||| Deciding to remain with a low profile, Ultraman suggested that they forget their own world and instead conquer this one, but Owlman was against it. Receiving news of the Justice League discovering their arrival, they left their low profile and went straight ahead against the League. Ultraman clashed against Supergirl until she was needed elsewhere and watched with indifference the display of power of the Omega Man. |||| |||| Witnessing the Omega Man's power, Ultraman apparently double-crossed the Syndicate and sided with him. Tired of his native Earth, Ultraman decided to help the Omega Man rule this Earth and destroy his old teammates. Watching his wife being beated by another amazon, Ultraman and the now evil Supergirl were waiting for the Omega Man's device to be completed so they could conquer the world, revealing that his' and the Syndicate's actions were a ruse to trick the League into helping them. However, turns out the League, too, was playing a ruse and tricked the Crime Syndicate to trap them and the Omega Man into the Multiverse."

In addition to his powerlance, the Black Knight carried a “paralyzer pistol” that fired a nerve gas. |||| |||| Paraphernalia |||| The Black Knight’s armor was a specially-designed steel-alloy chain mail that was bulletproof and electrically insulated. He also rode a flying steed that was mutated by his own genetic engineering.",,"A descendant of Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight from Medieval times, Nathan Garrett inherited Garrett Castle, the final resting place of Sir Percy. There, the spirit of Sir Percy appeared to him, charging him with becoming a modern-day crusader for good as a new Black Knight. However, Nathan proved unworthy and could not draw Sir Percy’s enchanted Ebony Blade. |||| |||| At some point, Nathan Garrett had become a Communist spy for the People’s Republic of China. He left his teaching position at Oxford University and became a U.S. citizen working for a research lab. He was also head of an espionage ring, selling American scientific secrets to China, until he was captured by Giant-Man (Henry Pym). He managed to flee to an undisclosed location in the Balkans where he decided to become the Black Knight, albeit one for criminal gain. With his new costume and weapons, he returned to America, but his first attempt at a robbery was thwarted by Giant-man, and he escaped again. |||| |||| The Black Knight was contacted by Baron Heinrich Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers’ Giant-Man. However, Zemo’s plan, to defeat the Avengers and hold New York in thrall, failed, because the Avengers switched up opponents and the Black Knight was beaten by Thor. He escaped prison once to battle Iron Man, but he was defeated and remanded to custody again. Broken out of prison by the Enchantress and the Executioner, he joined another version of the Masters of Evil, but was again defeated by the Avengers. |||| |||| The Black Knight again tried to focus his efforts on defeating Iron Man by kidnapping Tony Stark’s friend Happy Hogan and holding him in a castle that was reconstructed in Washington D.C. The Knight actually succeeded in defeating Iron Man by disrupting the circuitry of his armor, and he flew with him into the sky, hoping to drop him from a great height. Instead, Iron Man managed to unhorse the Knight and they both fell. Iron Man’s armor recovered enough to fly him to safety, but the Black Knight was believed to have perished in the fall. |||| |||| On his deathbed, the Black Knight reached out to his only living relative, Dane Whitman, and revealed the truth about his secret identity. Full of regret, he charged his nephew with using his weapons and technology for good instead of evil. Nathan Garrett died, but Dane Whitman fulfilled his promise by becoming the heroic Black Knight. |||| Years later, Nathan Garrett was resurrected by Immortus as a part of his Legion of the Unliving. Immortus pitted the Legion against the Avengers as he hoped to enslave the Scarlet Witch and thus control time itself. The Black Knight was a merciless version of himself, but he was nonetheless defeated along with the others on his team. He was seen again as a member of another Legion of the Unliving, resurrected by the Grim Reaper into the body of a plane crash victim. The Legion, little more than violent, mindless zombies, battled the Avengers on behalf of the Reaper, who was seeking revenge on the Avengers for supposedly killing him. When confronted with the truth of his own suicide, the Reaper lost control over the souls of the Legion, which returned to the afterlife, and succumbed to the demon, Lliogoroth, who was feeding him power."

Firestorm can project bolts of nuclear energy, fly at great speeds, and absorb explosive force and radiation into his body harmlessly.","Firestorm has the ability to affect inorganic matter alone.  If he tries to affect organic matter, he causes a potentially harmful energy feedback.  Also, while intangible Firestorm cannot create energy bolts.","Nobel Prize winning physicist Martin Stein was the designer of the Hudson Nuclear Facility.  One of Stein's colleagues accused Stein of stealing the plans for the facility, thus causing the plant to not open on time.  That night, an anti-nuclear power group, including high school student Ronnie Raymond, plans to protest and sabotage the facility.  Unbeknownst to Ronnie, the leader of the group plans to sabotage the facility.  As Martin Stein attempts to activate the reactor, he is attacked and left unconscious.  Ronnie Raymond attempts to rescue Professor Stein, as the reactor goes critical, bombarding Stein and Raymond with radiation, causing them to fuse into Firestorm, the Nuclear Man. |||| |||| Initially, Stein had no memory of his time as Firestorm, and the lapses in memory drove Stein into alcohol abuse.  Guilt ridden, Ronnie ceased initiating the Firestorm transformation, until a crisis necessitated Firestorm's return.  Ronnie then came clean about Firestorm to Professor Stein, allowing Ronnie and Stein to act as a team. |||| |||| Eventually, Professor Stein was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.  Convinced that Firestorm should go out with a bang, Stein convinced Ronnie to demand total nuclear disarmament. Caught at ground zero of a nuclear explosion with his Russian counterpart Pozhar, Firestorm found his matrix changed to Arkadin and Ronnie Raymond, though neither man controlled their new alter ego. Professor Stein (no longer part of the equation though heï¿½d unconsciously shaped the new Firestorm) was eventually located in a Nevada mental institution recovering from amnesia, but without free of hsi tumor. |||| |||| Later, this incarnation of Firestorm was nearly destroyed when a Russian clone of Firestorm absorbed his powers.  To prevent a threat, Raymond and Arkadin merged with the clone to create a new Firestorm, but they could no longer revert to their human counterparts. |||| |||| In the process, it was learned that Firestorm was originally meant to be Earth's Fire elemental, with Martin Stein as the sole host, however this had been corrupted when Ronnie attempted to save Stein.

However, Triumph inadvertently accepted an offer from Neron and sold his soul to regain the 10 lost years of his life.

336,Supergirl (DC)(Post Crisis)(03 - Kara Zor-El),Kara Zor-El ,336_20051120053858_char.jpg,Same as Superman of the post- Crisis Earth--but arguably stronger.,"She has a psychological aversion to long periods of time alone. |||| |||| Kara's aura does not protect her from magic-based attacks. She is vulnerable to mind control, as was the case with Saturn Queen and Dark Angel both manipulating her into making mistakes and destroying relationships with other heroes such as Power Girl and Powerboy. |||| |||| Kara is weaker or more prone to harm against magical creatures such as vampires & werewolf's. |||| |||| Being a Kryptonian, Kryptonite has harmful effects on Kara. Green-K will cause Kryptonite poisoning and ultimately death. |||| |||| Red Kryptonite has an unpredictable affect on Kryptonians. Examples of how Supergirl was affected by Red-K are as follows: changing into an adult Superwoman, splitting into two people, one half being Evil Kara, getting amnesia, and gaining the power to see through lead. However, the affects of exposure are only temporary, and if not fatal, will usually pass within one to 48 hours. |||| |||| Note that it was Kryptonite poisoning that caused all the bad girl behavior Kara displayed in the Superman/Batman comic, and in the first two years of Supergirl Vol. 5. Kryptonite poisoning caused her to not remember her childhood, allowing Darkseid to implant fake memories to create the Dark Kara persona. Thus all the memories of her killing students and murdering her mother was fake memories. Darkseid knew she would never kill her cousin willingly, so was trying to trick her into thinking she was saving the Earth from Phantom Zone phantoms if she killed Superman. However, she loved her cousin Superman too much to ever kill him for any reason. |||| |||| It was also Kryptonite poisoning combined with the fake kill Superman memories of Darkseid that was the secret reason for her violent behavior around other heroes. Examples include fighting the Teen Titans the first time they met; dislocating Superboy's jaw with a Super Punch; fighting the Outsiders; getting a tattoo; betraying the aliens in the bottled city of Kandor; not caring enough to even know her boyfriend's name; making out and then having a super fight with Powerboy; acting overly sexual and calling herself a crazy chick; All those out of character incidents and many more was caused by her Kryptonite poisoning; along with fake memories implanted by Darkseid; Lex Luthor using Kryptonite to bring out Dark Kara making the fake memories feel all the more real; Saturn Queen manipulating Supergirl's mind; Dark Angel manipulating Father Box, Powerboy, and Kara in an attempt to destroy her life. |||| |||| Besides her weakness to Green-K. Another kind is also very dangerous. But luckily Gold Kryptonite is rare. And fortunately so since it can rob a Kryptonian of their super-powers for 30 minutes, leaving them vulnerable to death by normal means. |||| |||| Blue Kryptonite has no effect on Supergirl, only on Bizarro imperfect duplicates. |||| |||| Kryptonians are able to harm each other more easily since they seem to be able to bypass each other's auras. |||| |||| Supergirl cannot see through lead. |||| |||| Supergirl would eventually weaken and become powerless without replenishing her energy reserves with normal (yellow) sun radiation. Also would lose her powers under a green sun. And retains powers in an orange-sun system and under a hotter blue-white sun her powers would be increased.","Numerical ordering of the name 'Supergirl' is highly problematic because of the many minor characters who have been known by that name, especially in the Golden and Silver Ages. For this reason, we will abandon the practice of 'numbering' Supergirls in favor of a more precise nomenclature. The Loeb/Turner 2004 relaunch of Supergirl was similar in many ways to the Loeb 2001 relaunch of Superman.  The recipe, it seemed, was to take a little something from each of the previous approaches to the character and blend it into a a simple, readily-coherent whole. While fans of the post- Crisis Supergirls may criticize Supergirl of New Earth for being a little TOO basic, the initial appearances of this version of the character have proven to be wildly popular among the comics-buying public. Like Supergirl of Earth 1, this Kara is definitely Kryptonian in origin, and, though there are characters in the DCU who have expressed doubt, appears to be definitely the cousin of Superman.   Medical scans have been shown to occur which appear to confirm this hypothesis. Other things that indicate her similarity to Superman are her fear of Kryptonite, the basic similarity of her power-set, and a mathematical extrapolation of her age given the known distance to Krypton and the speed of the craft. In an entirely Loeb-created twist, though, the journey of her craft was said to have kept her in some form of suspended animation, making her apparent age 'younger' than her actual age. She is in fact Superman's elder cousin, despite appearances and life experience. Though her identity as Superman's cousin seems all-but-absolutely-confirmed, her relationship with Superman has a bit more in common with Power Girl's relationship to Superman of Earth 2.  She visibly bristles at Kal-El's attempts to mentor her and has been shown to find more in common with Themyscira than the Fortress of Solitude. Indeed, this version of Supergirl has much more to do with Batman and Wonder Woman than any other version of the character, and the 'Big 3's' differing ideas on how best to help this Kara has been used to significant dramatic effect. Where Supergirl of the post- Crisis Earth was often depicted as a loner and Power Girl II has been a series of inconsistencies, Supergirl of New Earth has so far been able to act as a dramatically viable member of the larger DCU. So far, though, her lack of a secret identity has led all her interaction to be with other super heroes (or Amazons). Her initial appearance had certain commonalities with the Loeb-influenced portrayal of the character 'Kara' from the Season 3 finale of the TV program Smallville . Both that episode and issue #8 of Superman/Batman appear to have been produced around the same month in 2004, though it's an open question which was committed to paper first. Aside from the visual introduction (the first introduction to the comic Kara could be said to be an 'alternative' storyboard for the way the TV Kara was introduced), the main thing the comic and TV Karas share is initial amnesia. This is having profound implications for the development of the character because it introduces an element of doubt about her true origins, and it has set up the framework for a final post- Crisis definition of the only Supergirl variant still active in the DCU: Power Girl. Consequently, the origins of Power Girl as explored in JSA Classified have profound implications for this version of Supergirl. Indeed, Supergirl (2005) #1 was at least as much about Power Girl as it was about Supergirl of New Earth. As of this writing, it's unclear what that relationship is, precisely, but it is at least possible that an explanation might, in part, hearken back to concepts last explored in the later stages of Peter David's Supergirl run."

As such, he can elongate any part of his body, emit and control flames, use his control over flame to fly, become invisible, form invisible force fields, possess superhuman strength, and transform into a rocky hide/body armor. He is also capable of hypnosis. |||| |||| As a Skrull, Kl'rt is able to transform his body into any shape he wishes. Kl'rt is a trained soldier and commander in the Skrull army.",,"After the Fantastic Four stopped the Skrulls' attempted invasion of Earth, Skrull Emperor Dorrek invested vast resources into creating a superbeing of his own. K'lrt, a decorated soldier and warrior of the Skrull empire, was chosen to undergo a process that endowed him with all the powers of the Fantastic Four, except, when powered by an interstellar beam, far stronger. When the Super-Skrull first confronted the Fantastic Four, he bested them with their own abilities until Mister Fantastic identified the power source beamed from the Skrulls home planet and created a jamming device, depriving the Super-Skrull of his powers. Then the Invisible Girl tripped him into a crater and the Human Torch melted the rock around it to seal him in. |||| |||| Realizing their champion's predicament, the Skrulls developed a stronger source of power and beamed it to him. Re-powered, the Super-Skrull, disguised himself as Doctor Franklin Storm, the father of the Invisible Girl and the Human Torch, and again attacked the Fantastic Four. He called himself the Invincible Man, and claimed that he had received his powers in the Skrulls' prison laboratory. But Mr. Fantastic soon discovered the truth and threatened the Skrull homeworld with a fight to the death with the Super-Skrull and a direct atomic attack on their homeplanet. The Skrulls recalled the Super-Skrull and sent Dr. Storm back, although they first booby-trapped him with an explosive in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four. Storm, however, threw himself on the floor and took the brunt of the explosion to save his family and their friends, killing himself. |||| |||| His repeated defeats at the hands of the Fantastic Four allowed the Super-Skrull to fall out of favor with his government. Despite a second chance against the thunder Thor, the Super-Skrull was exiled. |||| |||| However, due to the loyalty to his race and his extreme power levels, the Skrulls have usually found they have need of the Super-Skrull, recalling him to service time and again. For example, Dorrek once hoped the Super-Skrull would the Kree Captain Marvel), disrupting the Kree from their surveillance of Earth, but Captain Marvel turned Kl'rt's power against him. Another time, he was drafted into the then-ongoing Kree-Skrull War, fighting the Avengers but hoping to take advantage of the war to increase his own political standing. This time, he was sent into permanent exile for treason. |||| |||| Working as a free agent, the Super-Skrull became an agent for Thanos the mad Titan, running once more into Captain Marvel. This time, his defeat left him stranded on Earth without interstellar transportation. Hoping to power a starship and flee the planet, he tried to steal the Cavourite crystal but was confronted by Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man. The Super-Skrull routed the two, but when he captured the crystal, its energies interfered with those of the interstellar beam that boosted his powers-- he found himself teleported to the Skrull throneworld. Unfortunately, he could never regain his physical form. |||| |||| The throneworld soon fell victim to Galactus, and the process of the planet's destruction send the Super-Skrull's disconnected form back to Earth, where it became trapped in the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Eventually, a group of scientists, including Dr. Walter Langkowski, a.k.a. the hero Sasquatch, made contact with the Super-Skrull's atoms with their equipment, inadvertantly allowing the Super-Skrull to reincorporate. The Super-Skrull's elation at being free was tempered with the fact that he was now physically dying. As a result of his entrapment within the radiation belts, he had developed a form of leukemia. Sasquatch battled the rampaging Skrull but was ultimately forced to return him to his discorporate state and return it to the Van Allen Radiation Belts once more. |||| |||| During his time of incapacitation, the Skrulls lost their natural shape-changing powers and their empire was decimated into factions. (In fact, K'lrt's wife R'Kll was the assassin who killed the Emperor Dorrek.) One of the self-proclaimed 'Empresses' of the empire's remnants, S'byll, tricked the Silver Surfer into using his power cosmic to re-form the Super-Skrull in order that they may aid her fleet in battle against the Badoon. This act threatened to escalate a new Kree-Skrull war, and the Super-Skrull convinced the Surfer to use his power cosmic to help him catalyze the latent shape-changing powers in S'byll's genetic structure. The two were able to awake the full power of a shape-changing Skrull in S'byll as well as to give her the ability to rekindle the shape-changing powers of others of her race. S'byll was sure that this ability would grant her support for her Empress-ship and allow the Skrulls to defy the Kree's genocidal efforts against the Skrulls. K'lrt stayed on as S'byll's champion, enjoying unparalleled fame as a great hero of the Skrull worlds. |||| |||| Shortly after, the enigmatic Stranger appeared and tried to add S'byll to his collection. The attempt was foiled when the pirate Captain Reptyl arrived on the scene and traded his entire pirate crew for her. In return for her freedom, he asked to become a privateer in her cause, and S'byll, happy to find a new ally, accepted his service. Enraged, K'lrt dueled with Captain Reptyl for the honor of being S'byll's consort and the Warlord of the Skrulls. K'lrt lost, and was believed slain, left to drift in space. In fact, the Super-Skrull did not die, but managed to find his way back to Earth where he decided to remain hidden until he could receive orders from a legitimate heir to Emperor Dorrek. |||| |||| At one point, the Super-Skrull duplicated the likeness of Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, fully assuming his identity in order to use the Rand Corporation and gain economic control of the Antarctic paradise known as the Savage Land. This conflicted with the plans of another company, Oracle Inc., owned by Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner. Namor, Namorita, and Misty Knight confronted Super-Skrull, who, with his plans ruined, abandoned Rand's identity and fled. (The assembled heroes set out on a search for the real Danny Rand, eventually freeing him from the alien H'ylthri.) |||| |||| During his time of hiding, he appropriated the identity of Lon Zelig, a master of disguise, and he quickly gained renown in Hollywood. Eventually, he was targeted for assassination by other Skrulls, who believed K'lrt to be a living representative of an old regime and a dangerous potential menace. The Skrulls tricked the Human Torch into fighting alongside them, but K'lrt defeated the attempt and revealed the truth to the Human Torch before disappearing once more. |||| |||| The Super-Skrull was impressed into serving a Skrull faction led by the Intelligentsia, a Skrull version of the Kree's Supreme Intelligence. Although he apparently bristled at her leadership, he followed one of her orders to kidnap Kelly, a girl on Earth who held a special connection to the nexus of all realities. This first brought him into conflict with Captain Marvel over her fate, but Kl'rt kidnapped her, rather than killing her as was ordered, and returned to Intelligentsia with her. Hoping to stage a coup, with the girl's powers, the Super-Skrull again fought off Captain Marvel, but Kelly instead turned her power on herself, negating her abilities, rendering the whole thing moot. The Super-Skrull was never seen working with the Intelligentsia again. |||| |||| By this time, S'byll had died when her Skrull throneworld was destroyed by Devos. The Super-Skrull joined a faction of the empire who were seeking an heir to Emperor Dorrek, believing him to be found in Teddy Altman, Hulkling. Teddy was the product of the union between the original Captain Marvel and Princess Anelle, during the time of Marvel's abduction by the Super-Skrull many years ago. Despite the interference of Teddy's friends, the Young Avengers, the Super-Skrull revealed the truth of Teddy's origin and killed his 'mother', a Skrull sent by the Princess to raise her son on Earth. Teddy was forced to acknowledge his heritage to both the Kree and the Skrulls, dividing his time between the two empires. In fact, unknown to all but the Young Avengers, Kl'rt impersonated Hulking, taking his place and his role in order to spy on the two races. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, however, the Skrull empire fell victim to the Annihilation Wave, although the Super-Skrull, for all his power, seemed helpless to stave its course. Believing his son to be residing on a planet in its path, Kl'rt and a Skrullian engineer R'kin hoped to find the secret to stop the Annihilation Wave and its weapon, the Harvester of Sorrows, from its source: the Negative Zone. Rallying troops from a penal colony within the Zone, the Super-Skrull was instead betrayed by R'kin, who held the Super-Skrull responsible for the death of his father. Imprisoned, Kl'rt used his hypnosis to force R'kin to free him and fellow prisoner Praxagora, the last of a robotic race. The Super-Skrull urged Praxagora to escape, but not before absorbing enough of her energy to make one final stand from within. Kl'rt sacrificed himself destroyed the Harvester, once more proving himself to be a hero for his people. Super-Skrull's body was later revealed to be in possession of Praxagora who had survived the explosion and joined the United Front against Annihilus. In one of the battles against Annihilus' forces Super-Skrull's body was reanimated by compination of Firelord's and Ravenous' powers as they unleashed them in the mist of the battle. He stayed with the United Front until the end of the war. |||| |||| Later, Ronan called both Kl'rt and Praxagora to Kree space in order to give them awards for their heroics during the war. However the Kree Empire was already infected by the Phalanx. Somehow the Phalanx had captured both Kl'rt and Praxagora and infected them with their techno-organic virus, causing them to become servants of the Phalanx. However, due to the intervention of the being known as Wraith both Kl'rt and Praxagora were freed from the Phalanx's control. |||| |||| Recently, Kl'rt made his way to Earth with the help of Nova during the Skrulls attempted take-over of Earth, Secret Invasion. After saving Nova from an army of Skrulls by pretending to have killed him, Kl'rt located his daughter, who was now living on Earth and working with She-Hulk as a freelance bounty hunter. Kl'rt had sworn that upon his next meeting with his daughter, he would kill her for being a traitor to their race. Unwilling to let Kl'rt kill Jazinda, She-Hulk battled Kl'rt, until Kl'rt was able to apprehend Jazinda. She-Hulk was able to piece together that Kl'rt was more upset that Jazinda had lived, while his son, who he considered his pride and joy, had died, and that is why Kl'rt despised Jazinda. In the end, Kl'rt did shoot Jazinda through the head, but did so knowing of the ability Jazinda has which renders her unable to die. Before she woke up, Kl'rt flew off, asking She-Hulk to tell Jazinda that he simply failed in his attempt to kill her, and to tell her anything other than he loved her."
254,Blue Devil,Daniel Cassidy ,254_20051219010959_char.jpg,"Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included Kevlar body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twenty-fold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a healing factor). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon. |||| |||| Originally, Blue Devil wielded a trident of his own design which included, among other things, rocket engines capable of carrying two people at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. He now carries the Trident of Lucifer, which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell.","Standard Demon weaknesses, i.e. Holy Water, Hallowed Ground","Dan Cassidy was a special effects wizard and stuntman hired to create and play the title character in the movie Blue Devil. To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered exoskeleton and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named Nebiros, Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body. |||| |||| Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with supervillains. Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of 'weirdness magnet'. Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the Justice League of America. |||| |||| When the demon Neron took control of Hell and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached. Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends. In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process. Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon. Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil. |||| |||| Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous Mist. His bones were secretly recovered by the magician Faust, who eventually restored Blue Devil to have him destroy Nebiros. Cassidy then joined the Sentinels of Magic and eventually gave his life a third time fighting Hermes Trismegistus. He did not remain dead long, however, and roamed the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell."

The Manhunters were the first attempt of the Guardians of the Universe to create an interstellar police force that would combat evil all over the cosmos. Their name and much of their code of behavior was modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the Manhunters of Ma'aleca'andra (Mars) millions of years ago (This creates an apparent chronology problem, since the Manhunters were created many millions of years ago, while the Green Martian race came into existence from the Burning Martians only about 20,000 years ago). For thousands of years, they served the Guardians well. However, the Manhunters became obsessed with the act of 'hunting' criminals. Their code, 'No man escapes the Manhunters' (corrupted from the original), became more important to them than seeing justice done |||| |||| Eventually, the robots conspired to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians defeated and destroyed most of them. Those that survived hid away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the Green Lantern Corps. The Manhunters infiltrated and liberated many planets disguised as living beings and created a 'Cult of the Manhunters' that trained others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world started a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erected a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters' agents were unaware that their masters were robots, or that their real purposes were not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes also known as Manhunters. They wore red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. |||| |||| The Manhunters were discovered by the Justice League who seemingly defeated the Manhunter's leader, the Grandmaster. One of their human pawns, Mark Shaw, adopted a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer. However, he was later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero. |||| |||| Years later, it was revealed that the Manhunters not only still existed, but had infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even managed to infiltrate the Olympian Gods, one of their number posing as the goat god Pan, as shown during the Challenge of the Gods storyline. They revealed themselves when a Guardian and a member of the Zamarons tried to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what became known as the Millennium crisis. On this occasion, there was a massive counter strike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seemed that the Grandmaster had finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopted his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself |||| |||| Kyle Rayner encountered the Manhunters not long after Hal Jordan's destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on Oa. The first of which encountered a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and was almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle used his wits to outsmart and decapitate it. The next time, multiple Manhunters appeared. They were all sentient, individuals, and captured Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They failed and Kyle managed to escape. |||| |||| When the Manhunters were replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreated to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, came to Biot and became the Manhunters' new Grandmaster. He used his mastery over machinery and Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of Parallax). Henshaw decided not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner |||| |||| The Manhunters resurfaced as part of the Sinestro Corps. They carried miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which were used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings. |||| |||| In a revision of Hal Jordan's beginnings, it was revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It was eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by Krona to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force. |||| ||||"
5006,N'Astirh,,5006_20060421231258_char.jpg,"Vast magical powers grants him the power to generate mystical energy as force bolts and protective shields, increase his size and strength, regenerate his injuries and tap into the innate evil of humans and turn them into demons with a touch. Flight due to natural leather wings. Techno-organic virus mutatation allows him to rebuild his body from a single cell when destroyed or injured, can infect others with techno-organic virus. Virus also granted him a computer like mind allowing him to cast spells and process them almost simultaneously.",,"N'Astirh was a demon with great magical skills and a master manipulator. Despite his power and loyalty to his lord Belasco he rebelled when Belasco chose a human, Illyana Rasputin as his apprentice. N'Astirh formed an alliance with S'ym, the strongest of Belasco's demons. When Illyana rose against Belasco, N'Astirh stole Belasco's spellbook and fled from Limbo into Earth's past. When Illyana left Limbo, S'ym summoned N'Astirh again and they plotted against her. Due to the Magus invasion of Limbo, S'ym was turned into a techno-organic being. As a techno-organic being, S'ym became more powerful and took over Limbo. |||| |||| N'Astirh made pacts with various villains in the Marvel Universe, such as Cameron Hodge, Hobgoblin (Macendale), and Madelyne Pryor. The latter used this alliance to get revenge against her creator Mister Sinister and her ex-husband Cyclops. N'astirh had previously led Madelyne to Sinister's genetic lab, to rescue her baby, and to confront Mr. Sinister. Madelyne then learned that she was merely a clone of Jean Grey, whom her husband had actually loved, and left her upon learning that she was still alive. With the help of N'astirh and his fellow demon S'ym, Madelyne's psionic powers (far stronger than her progenitor's) were triggered, transforming her into the Goblin Queen. When he realized that Madelyne could not be used as his pawn openly he devised another way of coercing her to the dark side. When she was bound and defeated by Sinister he left her to fend for herself while he infected himself with the transmode virus. The virus changes his coloring from green to red. He also claims he has 'become' magic, since he can now process and cast spells almost simultaneously. |||| |||| When N'astirh knew she had fallen into madness he returns and presents Madylyne her son as chief sacrifice. |||| |||| Madelyne Pryor, N'astirh and S'ym then plotted a demonic invasion, starting with Manhattan, known as the Inferno Crisis. During the invasion N'astirh also coerced Illyana Rasputin and Meggan towards their darker sides--Magik having a tie to the demonic realm Limbo (transforming her into Darkchylde) and Meggan being an empathic shapeshifter who was swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming her into the Goblin Princess). N'astirh was also known for his twisted sense of humor. When Jason Phillip Macendale, then the Hobgoblin, offered to make a Faustian bargain to trade his soul for the power of a demon, N'astirh laughed and scoffed at the offer, thinking Macendale's soul to be too pitiful to be of any worth. In return for amusing him, however, N'astirh granted Macendale's request by fusing the hapless human with a demon, which would eventually break away to become the Demogoblin. |||| |||| However N'astirh's invasion attempt was thwarted by the X-Factor, New Mutants, the X-Terminators and the X-Men. He was frozen and shattered and ultimately destroyed by an overload of lightning driven into him by Storm. |||| |||| Recently N'astirh has reappeared at the side of Illyana Rasputin, during the recent 'Quest for Magik' storyline. Whether or not this is the original N'Astirh or like Illyana a possible alternate reality version is unclear. This version appears to be more savage and primitive in nature and has not yet displayed any of the powers of the original. He also does not appear to be a techno-organic being"

261,Copperhead (DC)(01 - Unknown),,261_20070217061424_char.jpg,"The original Copperhead's contortionist skills allow him to fit himself into incredibly small spaces (such as chimneys). He originally wore a snake-themed costume. The suit was a weave of metallic and elastic fibers coated in vulnerable points (such as the chest) with Kevlar, making it bulletproof and impenetrable to almost any cutting edged weapon. The costume had been treated with a highly slippery water- and heat-proof silicon gel, allowing Copperhead to slide along any surface and slip out of tight spots. The tail could be stretched several feet and was strong enough to snap bone and shatter stone. The suit's helmet contained two seven-inch-long fangs which were capable of piercing human skin, and were coated in a potent neuro-toxin derived from copperhead snakes. The toxin could paralyze a person almost instantly, and death would follow within 30 minutes. |||| Later, the original Copperhead sold his soul to the demon Neron and was transformed into a human-snake hybrid. His reflexes and agility were greatly increased, and he gained venomous fangs, a forked tongue, claws, and a prehensile tail.",,"The criminal known as Copperhead first appeared in Gotham City in a snake costume. He committed numerous thefts before finally being apprehended by Batman and the first Batgirl. Copperhead then turned to more deadly pursuits as a super-assassin, constricting victims to a suffocating death with his costume's tail. During this time, he would become obsessive about his target and think of nothing until the target was dead, which proved to be a weakness at times as he would ignore anything he did not consider immediately relevant. |||| Copperhead used the travel opportunities his freelance career afforded him to pursue his hobby of collecting transistor radios. |||| Although a master contortionist, Copperhead was largely powerless without his snakeskin costume. He later sold his soul to the demon Neron in exchange for more power, being transformed into a deadly Snake/Man hybrid. He was later killed by Manhunter, Kate Spencer."
153,Lockjaw (Marvel),,153_20070225060724_char.jpg,"Lockjaw is able to teleport himself and a group of people up to a extensive distance, even from the Earth to the Moon. He also has an increased sense of smell and a strength in his jaw which may be due to his immense size.",,"Lockjaw is a member of the Inhumans royal family, mutated by the Terrigen Mists into his canine form. He followed along behind the Inhuman Crystal when she wandered from her family’s hidden base while they searched for their queen, Medusa. When Crystal met the Human Torch and confused him for an Inhuman, Lockjaw opened the hidden door to their base to let them both in and then teleported away. |||| |||| |||| When the rest of the Inhumans, led by Black Bolt, fought the Fantastic Four, Lockjaw appeared as his leader’s command and trapped the Thing with a steel girder. Even though the Thing bent the girder, he was unable to pry it from Lockjaw’s mouth until the Human Torch flew by and melted it. But Crystal appeared shortly afterwards and announced Triton’s capture by the Seeker, and so Lockjaw teleported the Inhumans back to Attilan while Johnny Storm and Crystal tried to stay together but were torn apart. |||| |||| |||| Lockjaw was in Attilan when Black Bolt took his crown back from his brother, Maximus, and reclaimed his leadership of the Inhumans. Later, Maximus tried to kill all of humanity with his atmo-gun, which failed because both Inhumans and humans were of the same race. And Lockjaw was seemingly trapped within Attilan, along with the rest of the Inhumans, when Maximus reversed his machine’s energies in a rage, creating a Negative Zone around the city. But his powers of teleportation allowed him to roam free, and he left the city, wandering the countryside and inadvertently terrorizing the populace; eventually running into the Human Torch and Wyatt Wingfoot. The pair tried to train him while he took them on a teleporting trip around the planet, and presumably off it, before sensing danger and returning them to New York in time to join the fight against Doctor Doom; who had stolen the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer. |||| |||| |||| When Maximus briefly regained the Inhuman throne, he used his hypnotic science to control Lockjaw and force him to teleport to the Baxter Building and kidnap the newest member of the Fantastic Four: Crystal. But Black Bolt soon freed his people and sent Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket, freeing Lockjaw."
2974,Abomination (Marvel),Emil Blonsky ,2974_20051218184831_char.jpg,"Blonsky's transformation into the Abomination substantially increased his bone/muscle mass and height (he stands 6 feet, 8 inches tall). The resultant levels of superhuman strength, endurance and durability surpass those of the Hulk when the Hulk is not angered; the upward limit of what the Abomination can press is over 150 tons and as high as 200 tons but not incalculably high. However, unlike the Hulk in most of his incarnations, the Abomination's strength does not increase as he becomes angry (the Abomination's strength does not nearly approach that of the enraged Hulk). Like the Hulk, the Abomination can use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances, covering up to two miles in a single bound. |||| |||| Unlike the Hulk, the Abomination's transformation has proved stable: he cannot change back and forth between his human state and his superhuman state, despite his wishes to the contrary. Though the Abomination has proven able to regenerate lost eyes and recover from other forms of massive cellular damage, his ability to regenerate tissue is much slower than that of the Hulk. The Abomination is resistant to extremes of temperature, and can hold his breath for extended periods of time; in the case of lack of air or heat, he may enter a coma-like state of suspended animation.",,"Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into The Incredible Hulk. As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk. While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form. |||| |||| Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. Both the Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath. |||| |||| In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General Thunderbolt Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat. |||| |||| Not only his grand scheme failed, Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhored the most - he was the rampaging, inhuman monster, not the Hulk he religiously believed all these years. |||| |||| Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulated the Hulk into attacking and almost killing Blonsky. The Abomination was taken into custody by the military; as punishment, he was forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost."

3247,Hellcat (Marvel),Patricia 'Patsy' Walker Hellstrom ,3247_20070104000757_char.jpg,Sensitive to some psychic phenomena. Athelete level physical strength enhanced when wearing her costume.,,"Patricia Walker was the only daughter of Joshua Walker and Dorothy Walker, a comic book writer. While she was still a child her mother acted as her agent, helping her at modeling and commercial work. Dorothy Walker’s greatest success was the creation of a comic book named after her young daughter, featuring romantic adventures of Patsy and her real-life friends as teenagers. The Patsy Walker comic book was very popular and continued for over a decade as Patsy grew into and out of her teens. Patsy Walker felt very strange about her mother’s fictionalized exploitation of her, and was relieved when the series ceased publication. Constantly exposed to comic books, Walker grew up to idolize the heroes her mother’s colleagues wrote about. However, she ceased daydreaming soon after high school and married her childhood friend, Robert Baxter (who had appeared in the Patsy Walker comic as her romantic interest.) Baxter was in the officers training program of the Air Force, and Walker spent the next several years of her life on a number of Air Force bases. |||| |||| |||| While her husband was assigned to a security post at the heavily government-subsidized Brand Corporation in New Jersey, Patsy Walker met the Beast and learned his secret identity. Walker had long idolized 'super heroes', and she elicited the promise from him that in exchange for keeping his secret, he would help her become a 'super heroine'. Walker’s marriage eventually came to a bitter end, and she sought out the Beast, who was now a member of the Avengers, to remind him of his promise. Tagging along with the Avengers to investigate criminal activities at the Brand Corporation, Walker discovered a costume like that worn by Greer Nelson in her identity as the Cat. Putting the costume on, Walker dubbed herself Hellcat and used her natural athletic abilities to help the Avengers. Walker believed that the costume had somehow enhanced her agility and speed, and by the power of suggestion more than anything else, it had. |||| |||| |||| Although she hoped to join the Avengers, Hellcat was persuaded by the Titanian priestess Moondragon to accompany her to Titan to undergo a period of training. During her stay on Titan, Hellcat’s minor psionic potential was artificially enhanced by various electronic organic devices (Moondragon used similar technology to give powers to Angar the Screamer and Ramrod) and was given extensive martial arts training. Upon her return to Earth, she met the Defenders and decided to accept their offer of membership rather than the Avengers. Hellcat remained a core member of the loosely organized Defenders for several years, becoming particularly close to the Valkyrie and Nighthawk. Eventually she met Damion Hellstrom, who in his costumed guise of the Son of Satan, joined the Defenders for a short time, and after he was cured of his demonic aspect found that she was in love with him. Renouncing her costumed identity, Patsy Walker decided to marry Hellstrom. The couple was married in Greentown, Ohio, where her father currently resided. The wedding, attended by several of her Defenders colleagues, was interrupted by her ex-husband 'Buzz' Baxter, who had assumed the costumed guise of Mad Dog, and the Mutant Force. The Defenders repulsed the attack and Hellstrom subdued Mad-Dog. The Hellstroms then moved to San Francisco where they established themselves as occult investigators. In this capacity, they helped several superheroes in mystical problems, notably the Avengers' West Coast branch. In helping the Avengers, Pasty again donned the Hellcat costume and remained on hand to help them capture the villains Tiger Shark and Whirlwind. |||| |||| |||| Sometime later, however, Hellstrom's dark soul reasserted itself and Patsy was driven mad at the sight of it. She languished in a near-vegetable state for months afterward until the mercy-killing entity Deathurge sensed her despair and, at her request, freed her spirit from her body, effectively killing herself. She soon after contacted Earth from a spirit plane and announced her intention via radio to return in the near future. |||| |||| |||| Patsy had ended up in the realm of the demon Mephisto, fighting an eternal battle in the so-called Arena of Tainted Souls, alongside fallen Avenger Mockingbird. Months later, the Avenger villain Grim Reaper resurrected Patsy and Mockingbird, among others, tainting them with his hatred for the Avengers and setting them against the team. With the help of the Scarlet Witch, Patsy and the others reverted to their true personalities and aided the Avengers against the Grim Reaper before returning from whence they came. Before she disappeared, Mockingbird was able to send a warning to her husband Hawkeye about a plan Hellstrom was developing. Hawkeye and his team the Thunderbolts confronted Hellstrom and then used their sorcerous connections to go to Hell in order to restore Mockingbird. They were tricked however, by Hellstrom, and the Thunderbolts rescued Patsy instead, restoring her bodily to Earth. |||| |||| |||| Pasty remained despondent and depressed due to her perceived failures in life and time spent in Hell. She nevertheless presented a good front, wrote an autobiography and began a book tour. Shortly thereafter, Patsy returned to Centerville to find her high school rival Hedy had joined with the corporation that was built upon the Patsy comics fortune and turned Centerville into a tourist attraction. Patsy discovered the town was also infiltrated with demonic forces, led by the evil warlock Nicholas Scratch. Scratch had allowed a cult called the Sons of the Serpents to use the citizens of Centerville for their occult purposes, and altering the Avengers, Patsy resumed her Hellcat identity and defeated the Serpents alongside her team. |||| |||| |||| Patsy was still despondent about life when later Scratch's minions attacked Hellcat. She then uncovered a plot by the extradimensional villain Dormammu to take over the various dimensions of Hell, each led by different demons, among them Mephisto, Hellstrom, and Satannish. Hellcat helped Mephisto thwart Dormammu by uniting the demons along with the death gods Pluto and Hela. She also revealed Hellstrom's father was actually Satannish, a pawn of Dormammu. Ultimately, she escaped back to Earth by proving to Mephisto that he would be better served to have her on Earth. Revitalized by her adventure, Pasty rededicated her life to super heroics as Hellcat. |||| |||| |||| One day, Patsy's supernaturally-tinged senses brought her to the attention of a homeless man. She tried to recuperate him, and he turned out to be the Defenders' villain Yandroth the Magician, who began systematically attacking Earth by binding the spirit of Mother Earth itself. Patsy escaped and managed to contact the various members of the Defenders to stop him, re-forming the team after a long hiatus. As a result of the battle, several of the Defenders were cursed to continually band together, and Patsy and the remaining Defenders elected to stay together as a team to support them."

He has a superhumanly strong and durable physique and ages far more slowly than most humanoids. His chief power is to stimulate the pleasure centers in the brains of others. Eros can surround himself with a personal force field so that he can travel through space and underwater, and can both fly and perform telekinetic stunts using his ability to harness gravitons.",,"750,000 years ago, Alars, a member of the Eternals of Earth, a cosmic-powered sub-species of humanity, departed Earth after his brother Zuras became the Eternals' leader. Alars journeyed to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where a band of exiled Eternal settlers had slaughtered each other in war. Alars married the only survivor, a young woman named Sui-San, and they transformed Titan into a paradise. Alars ruled the Eternals of Titan as Mentor and created ISAAC, a computer which serviced all of Titan's technological needs. |||| |||| The youngest son of Mentor and Sui-San, Eros had the natural ability to excite pleasure in others, but his power had no effect upon his mutant older brother, Thanos, who worshiped the cosmic embodiment of Death and led an army against Titan. During this assault, Thanos killed and dissected Sui-San, trying to learn why he was born different. While his brother was captivated by Death, Eros loved life, and began visiting other systems for adventure and romance. Eros even visited Earth at least once, and was remembered in Earth's legends. He had many lovers, but his only steady relationship was with the prostitute Heater Delight. Eros later helped Heater escape more than one possessive master, including Dark Roger and Axel the Rescorlan. While she was the property of Pro-Boscis the Procurer, Heater kept Eros from saving her because she didn't want his face damaged; she instead manipulated Pip the Troll into saving her. |||| |||| In recent times, Thanos conquered Titan with another army, slaughtering most of the Titans until Mentor and Eros were the only remaining resistance. Thanos, now seeking the Cosmic Cube, brought Rick Jones to Titan to learn its location. Rick was freed by Mentor, Eros and the Kree warrior Captain Marvel, who had been bonded to Rick; together, they battled Thanos' armies and drove off his lieutenant on Titan, the Super-Skrull. Mar-Vell ultimately bested Thanos by seemingly destroying the Cosmic Cube, and Mentor and Eros were able to rebuild Titan. Mar-Vell became a close friend of the Titans after his help. |||| |||| Thanos, however, had secretly left behind a programming virus compelling ISAAC to act on his behalf. Creating lieutenants for itself, ISAAC took the Titans captive. One lieutenant, Elysius, was attracted to Eros, but she later shifted her affections to Mar-Vell and changed sides when he came to Titan to oppose ISAAC. Mar-Vell ultimately drove Thanos' programming from ISAAC, saving Titan. Mar-Vell soon succumbed to cancer, spending his last days on Titan. Eros was devastated by the loss, and remained close to Elysius in the days that followed. Elysius eventually had ISAAC help her create a son from Mar-Vell's DNA; she named the child Genis. He was raised to believe that Eros was his father, and Eros helped maintain the facade until Genis' accelerated coming of age. |||| |||| Longing for new adventures, Eros visited Earth again and encountered the Avengers battling the Plantman. Eros asked to join their team and was accepted as an Avenger-in-training; but the Avengers were reluctant to present a man named 'Eros' to the public so the Wasp rechristened him 'Starfox.' Eros was chagrined to meet fellow trainee Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau), and he looked down on her, still stung by the death of Mar-Vell. Starfox learned teamwork and responsibility amongst the Avengers, but still found time to engage in several romantic liaisons, including a one-night stand with his teammate She-Hulk. The team also valued Starfox for his scientific knowledge as he was serving on a roster devoid of the Avengers' usual scientific geniuses. After many of the Avengers were taken to Battleworld to serve in the Beyonder's 'Secret Wars,' the Vision became the Avengers' chairman and promoted Starfox to full membership to fill out the roster. Starfox retained his standing when the other Avengers returned. |||| |||| One evening, Starfox invited himself and the Wasp to a party in Soho which was held by Sersi, a member of Earth's Eternals. When Sersi was brought to the Eternals' city of Olympia to participate in a gathering of all Eternals, Starfox was brought along. In Olympia, he fascinated his Earth-bound cousins with the story of how Alars had founded Titan. Starfox participated in the Eternals' Ritual of the Uni-Mind, merging with them into a single psionic entity; but when the villain Maelstrom tried to siphon the Uni-Mind's power for himself, and the Vision and Scarlet Witch freed the Eternals from the Uni-Mind. Starfox managed to incapacitate Maelstrom with his pleasure powers, which he revealed to the Avengers for the first time. Maelstrom caused his own death by having his servant Deathurge kill him so that he could live anew in another cloned body. The Avengers subsequently thwarted Maelstrom's next plot to halt the Earth's rotation. After seeing Captain Marvel's courage in that battle, Starfox finally accepted her use of his friend's name, apologizing to her for the way he had slighted her. |||| |||| The Avengers became embroiled in a civil war amongst the Skrulls, during which the pirate Nebula seized Thanos' star-ship Sanctuary II and used it to command a Skrullian fleet to destroy the planet Xandar. When Starfox confronted Nebula, she claimed that Thanos was her grandfather. Before Eros could learn more, Nebula was teleported away by the Beyonder, who had misunderstood the wish of the Xandarian survivor Firelord that Nebula be cast out of the galaxy. Starfox was determined to learn if Nebula's story was true, quit the Avengers to hunt her alongside Firelord. The pair were attacked by Super-Nova, another survivor of Xandar who incorrectly believed Nebula to be one of the Avengers, and Starfox was badly injured, but he soon recuperated and resumed his pursuit of Nebula. He finally caught up to her and helped the Avengers thwart her attempt to harness the Infinity Union, a device of the Stranger's which could grant her cosmic power. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Thanos obtained the Infinity Gauntlet (which housed the six Infinity Gems) and used it to offer the universe to Death. Thanos took Starfox hostage during the crisis so that his brother could witness his actions, but Thanos allowed himself to be beaten, not truly desiring victory in the end. Starfox continued to serve as an occasional Avenger, participating in the Avengers' mission to the Shi'ar Empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, as well as joining the Avengers against Morgan Le Fay when she mastered the power of the Twilight Sword. |||| |||| In the aftermath of that battle, Starfox befriended his fellow Avenger Tigra, and she set off into space with him to visit Deneb-VII. Tigra soon became bored of Deneb-VII, but the duo found new excitement when the universe was threatened by the Infinites, cosmic beings from another universe who had no regard for the lives of lesser beings. Starfox and Tigra teamed with Jack of Hearts, Quasar, Thor, Photon and Moondragon to face the Infinites. Starfox helped appeal to the Infinites through Eternity, the embodiment of space, and one of the Infinites ultimately chose to sacrifice itself to repair some of the damage they had done. Later, Starfox led a small army of Eternals in attacking Thanos (or possibly one of the 'clones' known as the Thanosi) during his quest for the Celestial Messiah, but they were soundly defeated and Eros was cast into outer space, beaten senseless. |||| |||| Starfox later confronted the time-traveler Thanatos, a version of Rick Jones from another reality intent on gathering items of power. Thanatos struck Starfox in the neck with the Spear of Destiny, causing a wound which could not be healed, then threatened to kill him unless he brought Rick Jones (now bonded to Genis) to him. Starfox was forced to comply, but Rick and Genis were able to defeat Thanatos in the end, reversing his actions. After Genis' power of cosmic awareness drove him insane, Starfox joined with Elysius, Mentor and the other Titans in opposing him; they were ultimately able to help Genis regain his sanity."

The boy was severely autistic, and as a result was subjected to various experimental treatments. One of these treatments seemd to bring the boy to a normal level of cognizance, but also brought out a streak of rage and violence. |||| |||| The boy saw images of Aquaman on television, and was drawn to the sight of a man completely submerged in his beloved water. As an adult, the orphan designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by black manta fish. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in several as-yet-unrecorded clashes with Aquaman before joining the short-lived Injustice League and later Orm the Ocean Master. |||| |||| Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years, until the day Manta killed Arthur III, Aquaman's son. Prior to Arthur III's death, it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an African-American man (and that this is why he called himself Black Manta), whose objective was for the Black people to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land. Most of Black Manta's henchmen were also black. |||| |||| Black Manta later sold his soul to the demon Neron in exchange for more power, and transformed into a Manta/Man hybrid. He took to wearing a new costume that completely covered his appearance, and inexplicably stopped tormenting Aquaman and instead indulged in drug smuggling from his new base in Star City. Here, he was opposed by Green Arrow and Aquaman. |||| |||| In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the Lady of the Lake's Healing Hand, reversed Neron's alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remained a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process. |||| |||| This entry uses information derived, either in whole or in part, from wikipedia.org."

Mentor is also able to calculate the weakest point in a structural formation or a living being. With his opponents, this ability allows Mentor to defeat them speedily and with little wasted exertion.",,"Mentor is a member of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, the super-intelligent Mentor was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Mentor was later among those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Mentor remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Mentor, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| Subsequently, Mentor was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. ||||"
935,Prometheus (DC) (02 - JLA Villain),,935_20050925142432_char.jpg,"Although he possesses no 'superpowers' in the technical sense of the term, Prometheus is incredibly intelligent, and has invented a variety of pieces of technology far more advanced than anything existing in reality. |||| |||| The most prominent device in his arsenal is his helmet, which contains a sophisticated computer wired directly into his central nervous system. This allows him to download any information -- from blueprints to files to another person's mannerisms to the fighting prowess of the world's 30 greatest martial artists -- directly into his brain. |||| |||| Other devices in his arsenal include a tonfa (dubbed 'the nightstick'), which contains an onboard computer of its own and which can generate an energy field allowing it to split anvils with a tap, and his gauntlets, which allow him to fire a variety of projectiles, from mundane bullets to darts containing any number of exotic chemicals. |||| |||| Prometheus also possesses the Cosmic Key, a device of alien origin which allows him to teleport to the interdimensional void known as the Phantom Zone (which he refers to as 'the Ghost Zone'). The Key also allows him to teleport others to the Ghost Zone against their will, and was once seen to disintegrate a man.","Prometheus' helmet, which provides him with his superior fighting skills and also serves as a repository of data on every superhero on the planet, is wired directly into his brain and nervous system. This leaves him vulnerable to attacks which tamper with the helmet. On at least two occasions, this has left him either partially or totally incapacitated.","Prometheus (his true name has never been revealed) was the only child of a pair of ruthless bank robbers and killers, and grew up accompanying them on their crime sprees. After one such spree, the two were cornered by police and chose to commit suicide by cop, dying before their son's eyes. Vowing to destroy 'the forces of justice,' he left home at 16, using both his parents' hidden stashes of money and the proceeds of a blackmail scheme targeting a local crime boss to finance his travels. Under a series of false identities, he studied at prestigious universities, trained as a pitfighter in Brazil, studied silat in Malaysia, joined a terrorist group in the Middle East, and worked as a mercenary in Africa. |||| |||| Eventually, he made his way to Tibet, where he discovered the mythical hidden city of Shambhala. There, he studied with a group of monks who worshiped evil, and eventually was taken into the bowels of the temple by their lama, where he learned the truth: the temple had been constructed atop a crashed alien spaceship many centuries before, and the monks were actually the aliens who had occupied it. Slaying the lama, he escaped Shambhala with the Cosmic Key, which allowed him to transport himself and others into an extra-dimensional realm he dubbed the 'Ghost Zone.' There, he made his base and began designing his costume and other weapons. After returning to America and slaying the police officers who had killed his parents, he decided he was ready to begin his crusade to destroy 'justice.' Although he had at first planned to blow up the Supreme Court, he instead decided to kill the Justice League. |||| |||| The newly-minted Prometheus' first opportunity came when the JLA, as a publicity stunt, created a contest to become 'hero for a day,' which was won by a naive young man called Retro. Slaying him, Prometheus used his helmet to download all of Retro's knowledge and mannerisms into his own head, using it to take his place and sneak aboard the JLA Watchtower on the Moon alongside a group of reporters. Once aboard the Watchtower, he put his plan into action. Using a computer virus programmed into his tonfa, he took control of Steel's armor, ordering it to walk to the far end of the base and then throw his hammer, which would breach the tower's walls. Next, he commandeered the Watchtower's computer, downloading its blueprints into his helmet and tampering with the air supply to increase the oxygen content. Confronted by the Martian Manhunter, he first shot him with a phosphorous dart to weaken him, then shot him with a second dart containing a 'molecular toxin,' which induced 'spastic paralysis' in the shapeshifter and left him a puddle of goo. After stopping to set the forest used to create the tower's air supply on fire, he used the Cosmic Key to teleport the angel Zauriel to the Ghost Zone and used a series of strobing lights on his helmet and his own voice to hypnotize the Huntress. Finally, he used the enhanced combat skills provided by his helmet to best Batman in hand-to-hand combat, poisoned Green Lantern with a 'neural chaff' that prevented him from using his ring, told the Flash that he had installed bombs throughout the base that would be triggered if he used his super-speed, then shot both Green Lantern and the Flash, non-fatally wounding them. |||| |||| Confronting Superman (who, at the time, was in his 'Superman Blue' phase and used electricity-based powers which rendered him effectively invulnerable) outside the shuttle bays, he informed him that he had sabotaged the shuttles, and would only allow the civilians to leave the tower alive if Superman committed suicide. If he refused, Steel's hammer would breach the tower's walls and kill everyone except Superman. This part of his plan was foiled, however, by Plastic Man, who had found Steel and absorbed the impact of his hammer before it could cause any damage. This proved to be Prometheus' downfall. The antihero Catwoman, who had snuck aboard the tower disguised as a reporter, distracted him by cracking her whip into his groin. While he was incapacitated, Steel, who had regained control of his armor, hacked into Prometheus' armor and disabled his helmet. Realizing he was beaten, Prometheus used the Cosmic Key to escape, pausing only to admit that he had been lying to the Flash about the bombs and return Zauriel to his place of origin. |||| |||| Over the next several months, he took to exploring the Ghost Zone, and soon discovered that he was not alone there: also present was a spaceship, used by the White Martians who had threatened the world at the time of the JLA's most recent reorganization, which was itself connected to the Watchtower. Realizing that this gave him a secret backdoor into the JLA's base, Prometheus contacted the billionaire supervillain Lex Luthor, and together the two became the nucleus for a revitalized Injustice Gang. Also invited to join were the alien Queen Bee and General Wade Eiling, now ensconsced in the invulnerable android body of the Shaggy Man. Unbeknownst to any of them, however, their minds were no longer their own. They had actually become the pawns of the sentient superweapon Mageddon, which hoped to use them to help spark the end of the world. Over the course of several weeks, they weakened and distracted the JLA by fomenting conflict all over the world, touched-off a supervillain riot at Belle Reve Penitentiary as a diversion to steal and sabotage the Green Lantern's ring, and planted bombs throughout the Watchtower. Once the Queen Bee's space fleet had assembled in the asteroid belt, the team put their plan into action. |||| |||| Prometheus' assignment was to disrupt the team's technological link, which was coordinated by Oracle from her base in the Gotham clocktower, and download all the team's secrets into his helmet. Infiltrating Oracle's base via the Watchtower, Prometheus offered her a deal: in exchange for willingly going along with the Gang's plans, he would use the same techniques that allowed his helmet to interface with his nervous system and improve his physical prowess to fix her paralysis and allow her to walk again. When she refused, he engaged her in a supremely brief fight, tossing her straight through the face of the clocktower (she survived by hanging onto a hand), although not before she managed to lightly damage his helmet. Disabling the League's communications, he returned to the Watchtower, where he switched out his damaged helmet for the slightly outdated model he'd left behind during his first appearance, and made short work of the Huntress. Confronting Batman in single combat once again, he quickly gained the upper hand. This time, however, Batman played his trump card: he had studied and dissected the outdated helmet Prometheus was wearing, and had cracked its secrets. He then proceeded to overwrite the program Prometheus was using to power his martial arts skills, replacing them with the physical characteristics of Dr. Stephen Hawking, the eminent physicist afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease, leaving him completely paralyzed. |||| |||| Although this confrontation resulted in Prometheus' capture, he resurfaced again a few months later, with no explanation as to his escape. Unbeknownst to anyone outside the JLA, however, this Prometheus was not the genuine article at all. He was, in fact, Chad Graham, the psychopathic son of one of the policemen who had killed Prometheus' parents. After murdering his own parents before Prometheus could get to them, Graham had been taken under the villain's wing and trained in the hopes that he would become a sidekick to him, much as Robin is to Batman. With the real Prometheus disabled and left in a catatonic state by the telepathic powers of the Martian Manhunter, Graham adopted his costume and weapons and began working under his name. This faux Prometheus, over the course of several real-life years, served as bodyguard to the Batman villain Hush, was press-ganged into the Secret Society of Super-Villains, battled Captain America as part of an inter-company crossover, and was mind-controlled by Starro the Conqueror. Through it all, he proved himself unable to live up to the standards set by the actual Prometheus, and by the end of his run had been defeated in hand-to-hand combat by both the Huntress and Robin. |||| |||| Recently, with the death of the Martian Manhunter, the true Prometheus has reawakened. Escaping from the mental institution where he had been housed, he tracked down Graham and found him being pursued by the members of the superhero team Blood Pack. Casually slaying one member of the Pack and crippling another, he abducted Graham to his base in the Ghost Zone. Outraged at the damage done to his reputation by Graham's performance, he lit him on fire. As his former sidekick burned, Prometheus vowed to soon reclaim his rightful place as a figure of fear and respect, both in the underworld and without."

344,Chronos (DC)(01 - David Clinton),David Clinton ,344_20051031024144_char.jpg,,,"Considered by some to be the arch-nemesis of the Atom (Ray Palmer), Chronos started his career as petty thief David Clinton who attributed his consistent incarceration to his timing, or lack there of. To improve his timing he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career. He then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials). |||| Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos's weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions -- lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggested that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. |||| Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group a six-inch tall aliens in the Amazonian jungle. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during Darkseid's anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost Captain Atom. |||| Upon his return to the present Chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune, but old habits die hard, and Chronos's illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the Calendar Man to work with the Time Foes, but was captured by the Team Titans. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance -- he accepted an offer from the demon Neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to travel through time. However bargains with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his ageing. A man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen. |||| All the experiments and Neron's 'gift' had taken a toll on Clinton's body and be began to loose touch with any sense of the 'now.' He had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness. His disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into 'The Void' of time. A funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second Chronos (Walker Gabriel). This entry uses material derived in whole or in part from wikipedia.org ."

They are near ageless, immune to all diseases and have superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and a high level of resistance to injury. Volstagg possesses the conventional superhuman abilities of an Asgardian male. |||| |||| Volstagg is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Volstagg is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Volstagg's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina.

He has also used the Elixir of Recovery, an Asgardian medical potion. |||| |||| Volstagg also is known to have a specialized weapon, the Brandrheid Undrsigr, also known as the Bright Blade of Wondrous Victory.",,"Volstagg is an Asgardian and the large, jovial member of the Warriors Three. Seemingly much older than other Asgardians, Volstagg will often be the cause of more problems than the solution. He likes food and drink and is very boastful. Despite his flaws, Volstagg is a trusted member of the Warriors Three and a trusted ally to Thor. Volstagg has a large family and an unknown number of children with his wife, Gudrun. The most well known of these is Hildy. Originally Voltsagg was a slimmer and more athletic man, in his days before meeting his future cohorts and best friends Fandral and Hogun. Volstagg was known and celebrated as a mighty warrior and adventurer. He would exclaim that a dead frost giant a day, by his hand, was required to cater to his battle lust. An encounter with a younger, brasher Fandral however resulted in a bet, a challenge in which both warriors would try to prove who was the greater and braver adventurer. A much quieter and shier Hogun would be the judge and impartial observer. The challenge? To pet the monstrous creature wolf creature Fenris on his head. However the journey itself to the bounded and mighty Fenris itself was tasked and fraught with adversity. Adversity that brought the three men to friendship and loyalty, and by the time Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun reached their destination they were bonded in friendship. |||| |||| An incident and a pact would happen subsequently, one that would supposedly affect Volstagg's psyche to such an extent he would let his muscular physique fall to appetite, however this is somewhat ambiguous theory. Years later after his own adventures both apart and with the Warriors Three after an order by Odin himself calling forward for Asgard's greatest warriors, Volstagg and his co Warriors Three reunited and have been a constant defender of both Asgard and their inhabitants and allies, including Thor, Sif and Balder. |||| |||| *** THE WARRIORS THREE *** |||| A much younger and slimmer albeit still large and physically imposing Volstagg ends up having a quarrel with the young and show boating warrior Fandral. Hogun, a meek and quiet young man is witness to their banter and taunts. The task the two more confident warriors put forward to each other, is to venture forth into dangerous territories to find the menacing Fenris Wolf and to pat it on the head. The first of either Volstagg or Fandral to achieve this, will be considered the victor of the dispute that had just arisen! After days of travel, the three warriors facing arduous challenges, one after the other, they reach the menacing Fenris Wolf. Chained still, but still an impressively fearful sight. Though at this stage, after much travel and bounding, Volstagg and Fandral and Hogun are more brothers endeared than rivals with arrogant attitudes towards each other. No long is this a quest of individual pursuits but a challenge for a team. Unfortunately the young trio have underestimated the Wolf Fenris. The beast forces the young trio into a pact, to be paid at a later date. This pact was necessary but weighed in on the three Asgardians conscious. |||| |||| In modern day era, and times, Volstagg has tasked himself a challenge at a Bronxton Food Diner with an All You Can Eat Challenge (rather menu) failing to realize that the All You Can Eat meal wasn't an actual challenge, much to the horror of the establishments owner. However once the Gjallarhorn of Heimdall sounded, Volstagg was quick to join his close companions for the emergency that the horn's blow meant. The emergency warranting their attention, was that Fenris had escaped. With their history with the beast, the Warriors Three set about trying to capture him. Volstagg along with Fandral and Hogun discover that Earth corporation AIM is involved and worse still, trolls, Rock Trolls, bar their path led by the dangerous Ulik. With Fandral injured its Volstagg that is instrumental in defeating the trolls. Further on in their quest to apprehend Fenris they encounter a AIM employee, however they are quick to realize she is not normal human - she has been infused with Fenris' blood, providing her augmented strength (enough to lift and throw Volstagg himself), speed and durability. After a small skirmish they learn her name, Helen Gable and they realize she is an ally. The Asagrdians learning that AIM has been weaponizing Fenris and more than that, the deal they struck with him, had resulted in Fenris being able to shape shift into a mortal guise. A most unsettling development. Worse still, he planned on taking a power Ragnarok bomb to the heart of Asgard where he would destroy it, and destroy himself as well. With their new ally the Asgardian warriors are able to trick Fenris defeating him and preventing him from succeeding in his attack against Asgard. Volstagg had a pivotal role in the plan, as it was he who had the strength to lift the giant Ragnarok bomb and carry it away from Fenris, the Ragnarok bomb significantly larger in size than Volstagg."

Sif is a skilled warrior and staunch defender of the innocent. And an ally to The Warriors Three. |||| |||| *** ORIGIN *** |||| Lady Sif and her brother, Heimdall, were born of the second generation gods of Asgard, although their parentage has yet to be revealed. During their childhood, Sif was a constant companion of Thor, Balder, and Loki. Upon reaching her adolescence, Sif and Thor seemed to develop a romantic relationship, which even Odin approved of, deeming her worthy to one day become the wife of her childhood friend. However, Loki, who grew jealous of Sif's affection towards Thor, decided to play a foul prank on the Asgardian when he cut off the golden hair for which she was renowned. This misdeed was quickly discovered when Sif awoke and Thor forced Loki to restore her hair. Loki attempted to create a bargain with the trolls Brokk and Eitri, who made the hair out of pure gold. Unfortunately, Loki stole the newly created hair before it was able to be treated with a special potion and upon placing the hair on Sif's head, it grew darker by the minute before finally turning as black as night. Sif continued to grieve over the loss of her golden hair until her parents finally tired of her vanity and sent her to learn the way of the warriors by having her train to become a shield maiden. |||| |||| During her time in training, Sif still accompanied Thor and Loki on adventures, although she never forgave Loki for his cruel prank. Sif often attempted to get romantically closer to Thor and even developed a brief rivalry with Amora the Enchantress and Brunhilde, the future Valkyrie, when she was tricked by the former and Loki into stealing the Mirror of Mycha from Karnilla's palace. Amora and Loki both told Sif that she would be able to use the mirror to permanently capture Thor's affections, but Amora used the mirror on Thor before Sif had the opportunity. Brunhilde eventually came to Sif's aid when the two put aside their differences to work together and release Thor from the mirror's enchantment. Although Thor was disappointed in Sif's initial attempts to use the mirror, the two quickly made up and rekindled their budding relationship. |||| |||| *** CREATION *** |||| Sif is a Marvel comics character based on and inspired by the mythological Norse goddess of the same name, Marvels Sif was adapted/created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby and first appeared in Journey into Mystery #102 which was released in 1964. A supporting character of Thor's stories in Journey into Mystery Sif would naturally continue this supporting role when the title would change to simply Thor two years later in 1966. Sif would make regular appearances in this title as a valued warrior of Asgard, and also a romantic context with Thor but eventually Sif would also be starring in her own plots and story-lines. In 2012, Sif would undertake a significant new chapter and for the first time would be the starring and leading protagonist of a book in Journey Into Mystery written by Kathryn Immonen. Speaking of the character she would write 'Sif's got her origin story, but beyond that she's really kind of a blank slate aside from the broad strokes of her personality,' Immonen says. 'It's thrilling that the real estate has been put aside to develop her character in a way that hasn't really been done before.'The mythological Sif is first attested to in the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda from the 13th century. Sif is also associated with the earth, hunting, harvest and fertility. |||| |||| *** SILVER AGE *** |||| Sif first appeared in the Thor title as it was written under Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. With some fifty issues of Thor already under their collective belt, the two creators had already had and introduced a variety of supporting characters for the titles main protagonist the mighty Thor, including the books main romantic interest for the protagonist Jane Foster. They would introduce Sif in the modern area (Sif's first appearance in Journey Into Mystery #102 was a flashback) with a storyline wherein Jane Foster would travel to Asgard with Thor, Thor hoping that she would met Odins approval and be transformed into a god so the two could marry. Jane would fail Odins test also earning failing to impress the all father. Sif would be introduced in this arc to essentially add another potential romantic interest for Thor as well as add another Asgardian supporting character as well as one adapted from the real world Norse mythology like Thor. Sif would enter the scene with the Thor character heartbroken after losing Jane Foster. Sif would be introduced as an immortal and warrior to contrast against Fosters mortality and all to human fragility. Aiding Thor in battle against the Lurking Unknown would spark new hope, romance and enthusiasm in the thunder god, and would also mark the beginning of Sif's role in the Marvel Universe. After Jane Foster failed Odin's tests to win Thor's love, Sif was introduced, and she joined Thor on many adventures as a fellow warrior. |||| |||| *** SON OF ASGARD *** |||| In her early years a young Sif would often spend time with Thor and Balder, adventuring, training, fighting and laughing. One particular source of amusement for young Sif would be watching Thor fruitlessly struggling to lift the mighty enchanted uru hammer Mjolnir. She would still empathize with the son of Odin when he failed to lift it, pointing out that he may still wield the weapon in the future and that she laughs at his inability to give up. The three would discuss Mjolnir and Sif would point out how she didn't like how the inscription on Mjolnir specified the male gender when she might be just as worthy to lift it one day. Balder and Thor would agree with her idea, possibly not wishing to incur Sif's wrath. Loki overhearing the three would be annoyed by Sif's negativity towards him and so set about using magics to increase the size of three common spiders causing them to grow incredibly massive. Sif, Balder and Thor would grab more common weapons and slay the massive spiders much to Odin's pride as he would enter the room as the three teens would finish their battle. Acknowledging their teamwork and battle prowess Odin would reward the trio with a challenge, a quest and an adventure. Odin has set the objective for Sif, Balder and Thor to gather magical and rare materials that Odin shall forge into a legendary sword that shall be gifted upon a deserving Asgardian warrior. They trio are to gather a scale from the dragon Hakurei from the land of Nastrand. To acquire a feather from the massive snow eagle Gnori, residing in Jotunheim, a precious jewel from Jennia, and a vial of water from Lake Lilitha in Lilitha."

Intellectually advanced, he studied both science and the secrets of his mother's witchcraft early in life, and came to the United States on a scholarship to Empire State University. |||| |||| At school, von Doom became acquainted with both Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, later of the Fantastic Four.  His studies focussed on trans-dimensional communication and travel, fixated especially on methods of communicating with his dead mother.  Due to his feelings of insecurity at Reed Richard's scientific genius, von Doom ignored Richard's advice, and his experiments led to an accident in which he was facially scarred.  Following this event, Victor was expelled from school, and went out into the world, seeking a cure for his condition (which may or may not have been that serious in actuality).  All of this, reasonably or not, would lead him to a life-long enmity towards Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| In Tibet, Victor spent time with Tibetan monks, learning further sorcerous secrets.  When the monks crafted a suit of mystical body armor, von Doom donned his mask before the iron face-plate had cooled, further disfiguring himself.  Later, the suit would be significantly improved by way of technological and magical enhancements. |||| |||| Now calling himself 'Doctor Doom', he returned to Latveria and promptly overthrew the country, installing himself as a (relatively) benevolent dictator.  Swearing himself to world domination and revenge on Reed Richards, Doom proceeded to enact any number of schemes to extend his personal power. |||| |||| In later years, after Doom extended his knowledge of mystical powers even further, his soul was consigned to Hell following further conflicts with Reed Richards.  Most recently, he appears to have returned to life after Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, passed through the Hell dimension on its way back to Earth."

Her strength is also at high superhuman level, sufficient to go one-on-one with She-Hulk.",,"Mary MacPherran was born prematurely to a poor family, both of which contributed to her small and fragile frame that she never quite grew out of. The more popular girls in high school would tease her with the name “Skeeter,” short for mosquito, and the name stuck. Her only friend was Marsha Rosenberg, herself a social outcast. Mary had only enough time for work and school and little else, and she spend her spare time dreaming of winning the lottery or of being struck with a sudden superhuman origin. |||| |||| One day, she happened upon one of the first sightings of Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter). Caught up in the public fervor over her appearance, Mary claimed that she was Spider-Woman. The rumor got out, and the insinuation was enough to get her and Marsha invited to an important social function hosted by her high school rival. Unfortunately, this happened at the same time the Beyonder (now, the Maker) tore a section of Denver in order to create the Battleworld for a collection of Earth’s heroes and villains to fight each other. Mary was made an even bigger pariah when the real Spider-Woman appeared to save the party guests. Despondent and hopeless, Mary fled with Marsha only to encounter Doctor Doom. Doom offered the women a chance to become super-powered in exchange for joining his army. Mary agreed, and Doom used the alien technology of Battleworld to transform her into Titania and Marsha into Volcana. |||| |||| Titania and Volcana joined the other villains, where she immediately found company with the Absorbing Man, whose raw physical power she greatly admired. The villains successfully attacking the heroes’ fortress, and Titania managed to fight various X-Men to a standstill. She even seemed a match for She-Hulk; however, Titania failed to see the fight through and was forced to ask for help from the other super criminals. Her confidence shattered, she fought Spider-Man, but despite her superior strength, Spider-Man defeated her, and she has had a strong fear of facing Spider-Man in combat ever since. Soon, the villains banded together to escape with the Molecule Man, who used his power to return the Denver suburb to Earth. |||| |||| Titania and the Absorbing Man remained together as a couple, even participating in many crimes together. The two were recruited by Baron Zemo in his incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but they encountered the Wasp and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) before they could rendezvous with the team. Most often, though, Titania would seek out ways to pit herself against She-Hulk, always hoping to have the chance to redo the outcome of their initial fight, which Titania always considered her first true failure. Time and time again, however, She-Hulk would always best her. |||| |||| After many months, Titania and Absorbing Man got married, with Volcana as her bridesmaid. Although their large, super villain-filled wedding ceremony was interrupted by the Avengers, the heroes left Titania and the Absorbing Man alone. Both villains had seemed to have turned away from more malicious actions, preferring to quietly keep each other company, although they never gave up bank robberies and other activities completely. Titania and Absorbing Man occasionally continued to come into conflict with superheroes, such as the Black Widow, who, in a vendetta to dispose of all Avenger's villains, she shattered the Absorbing Man's altered form. (The Absorbing Man would later recover.) Later, the couple attempted to rob the high class restaurant Heaven's Grill, where they were stopped by Luke Cage and She-Hulk. |||| |||| Later still, the Absorbing Man returned to crime, revealing that Titania was dying of cancer and that he needed to pay for treatment. They kidnapped a doctor but were confronted by Thor, who convinced them to seek professional care. |||| |||| Titania soon recovered, but she became obsessed with the idea of besting She-Hulk. She trained in an all-consuming manner, so much so that she failed to notice when the Absorbing Man was remanded to police custody. She managed to boost her strength to unprecedented levels and raced to confront She-Hulk. With one punch, however, She-Hulk kayoed Titania. In fact, She-Hulk herself had similarly reached new levels of strength, as she had just come from training for an interstellar bout that pitted her against Tryco Slatterus, the Champion of the Universe. Now called the Fallen One because he lost the bout, Tryco offered Titania the use of his Infinity Gem of Power, training her with it so she could defeat She-Hulk. (After which, Titania promptly dropped a mountain on him, so he wouldn’t take the gem away.) |||| |||| Titania did indeed best She-Hulk and would have killed her if She-Hulk didn’t manage to slip away after transforming into her alter ego of Jennifer Walters. Awesome Andy, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man all tried to keep Titania at bay, but she defeated them all. Ultimately, Jennifer tricked Titania into thinking she killed She-Hulk, but it was really Ditto, a shape-changing process server. It was enough to allow Titania to fulfill her single-minded purpose, which released her hold on the Power Gem. Now She-Hulk, with a bigger overriding desire to see Titania thwarted, was able to wrest the gem from Titania’s brow and defeated her. She was imprisoned again, serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized."

Ollie had previously retreated to the ashram decades before, looking for peace after accidentally killing a criminal (in The Flash [2nd series] #217). Ollie returned to the ashram under similar circumstances, haunted by the thought that he had killed his former best friend Hal Jordan, who he at the time believed had gone insane and become the villain Parallax. Thanks to Connor, who was a big fan of Green Arrow, Ollie was able to regain a semblance of inner peace and venture out into the world again, especially after numerous attempts on his life had been made. |||| |||| Connor decided to journey with Ollie, and created a costume similar to his. Connor served as Ollie's sidekick, also meeting with Eddie Fyers, the former federal agent that acted as a form of counsel for Ollie. It was during this time that Ollie learned about his connection to Connor (albeit from the ghost of Hal Jordan): Connor was Ollie's son, conceived during Ollie's stay at the ashram twenty years before, a truth that Eddie Fyers had already deduced. Ollie didn't take it well and stormed off, agreeing to go undercover in an eco-terrorist group called the Eden Corps for the government. The mission turned out to be fatal for Ollie, as his arm was connected to a bomb in a plane that was headed for Metropolis. Rather than endanger Metropolis, and refusing to allow his arm to be amputated, he sacrificed himself to let the bomb explode away from the city. With his father dead, Connor decided to take up the mantle of Green Arrow and continue his hero's work. |||| |||| Connor continued to travel with Eddie, accompanied at times by Connor's martial arts mentor Master Jansen, as he tried to find his place not only in the hero world, but also in the legacy of Green Arrow. Akin to the friendship between his father and Hal Jordan, Connor became quick friends with the new Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, who himself was struggling to live up to a legacy. Connor also met Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Ollie's former and longtime romantic interest, who gave him one of Ollie's old bows, which Connor would use from then on (however, the news that Ollie was dead would send Black Canary, who was already suffering from a string of misfortunes – loss of income from the destruction of her florist shop and the loss of her superhuman ability – into a despair which would only be ended by her association with Oracle). |||| |||| Besides making friends, he also came face to face with Lady Shiva, said to be the deadliest assassin in the world, and was able to fight her almost to a stand-still, making him one of the very few to have survived battle with her. |||| |||| Connor also applied for membership in the JLA, taking his father's place. On what would be his second interview, he single-handedly saved the League from the hands of the Key. Connor defeated the Key's robots using his father's old trick arrows since his own were destroyed. In the end, he knocked out the Key using the famous boxing glove arrow, and was accepted as a member of the League. |||| |||| He would later be used by Batman as a 'traitor' in the League in a ploy to defeat Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang. Connor would leave the League afterward, feeling he was better suited for the street-level work and out of his element in the epic adventures of the Justice League, although he did remain on reserve status. He and Eddie would then return for a time to the ashram where Connor was raised, although they both often returned to the outside world, aiding Robin, Spoiler and Batgirl. |||| |||| When Ollie returned from the dead, Connor left the ashram and tracked him down. Connor and Ollie moved in together in Star City. The two live with Mia Dearden, a runaway that Ollie has taken in and trained as his new sidekick Speedy. Since returning to the superhero life, Connor has been wounded seriously twice, once by the villain called Onomatopoeia and once by Constantine Drakon, but he continues in his hero role. He is the voice of reason for Ollie, and the two have since formed a real father-son relationship. During his recovery from Onomatopoeia's attack, Oliver Queen and Roy Harper, his former sidekick, on a trip across the country recovering old possessions. One of them, was an old photograph, reveal that Oliver had been present at Connor's birth, but later ran from the responsibility of being a father. Oliver still keeps this fact from his son. |||| ||||"

Cobert subjected himself to his own experiments and became a destructive, dim-witted giant dubbed Leviathan who proceded to go on a rampage before being subdued and imprisoned by SHIELD. The Secret Empire, who had agents also held in SHIELD custody, arranged for Leviathan’s release, and his subsequent rampage in the streets of New York was stopped by the Defenders, but not before the Secret Empire secreted their agents away. |||| |||| Leviathan was somehow also freed by the Secret Empire, for when the Defenders managed to infiltrate the organization’s headquarters, Leviathan helped capture the team.

The Masters of Evil were thwarted by the Guardians of the Galaxy who were visiting the mansion, but both teams were forced to band together to fight their doppelgangers. After defeating them all, Doctor Octopus hoped to continue the battle against the Guardians, but Gargantua and the others refused to turn on the heroes who had helped them survive and disbanded after forcing Doctor Octopus to flee."

480,Talia al Ghul (DC),,480_20051203103259_char.jpg,,,"Talia was the younger daughter of Ra's al Ghul, considered heir to his empire despite her independent streak. |||| She entered Batman's life when he rescued her from Dr. Ebenezer Darkk, who had recently split from Ra's League of Assassins. After her rescue, she shot and killed the man who had affronted her father. Batman's arrival caught her attention, and after telling the Demon's Head of this heroic figure, began a relationship that mixed passion with betrayal, love with deceit, and left the Dark Knight with a son. |||| |||| The entire Dr. Darkk incident was considered a test for Batman, gauging his suitability to assume control of the league and run Ra's operation. Ra's had Robin kidnapped, then introduced himself to Batman in the Batcave, noting that his own daughter was kidnapped in the same way. Batman's investigation and rescue of the pair convinced Ra's that Batman was a suitable heir, but the Dark Knight rejected the offer of Talia and Ra's business. |||| |||| From the beginning, Talia found herself drawn to Batman despite their differing views of the world. His outright rejection of her father's offer, and subsequent efforts to dismantle the league, only seemed to encourage her own independence. When Batman and Ra's dueled in the desert, he was struck by a scorpion; as he lay dying under the blazing sun, she slipped him the antidote. |||| |||| Little has been recorded about her early years or even who her mother was. She was clearly well educated in the arts and sciences in addition to being trained in weaponry and martial arts. She never knew her older half sister, Nyssa Raatko, and seemed to have been raised in isolation, under a's watchful eye. Her mother, of mixed Asian and Arabic descent, met the Demon's Head at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. One account indicated that the woman's name was Melisande, and that she was killed by one of Ra's servants, Qayin. Another account left the woman nameless and said she died from a drug overdose. Over the next several years Talia would turn up in Batman's life as ally or opponent, as the situation dictated. He continued to acknowledge but resist the attraction between them. At one point Ra's ga sed Batman, and when he awoke the Dark Knight discovered that Ra's had performed a marriage ceremony for him and Talia. The marriage remained unconsummated at that point: The Caped Crusader escaped and refused to acknowledge the bond. At some later point they did finally admit their attraction and love, which resulted in another ceremony, followed by the birth of their son, Damian. |||| |||| However, he continued to reject Talia so Ra's had her betrothed, instead, to Bane. She rejected the international brute, and after Batman defeated him, Ra's agreed that he was unworthy of his 'only' daughter. Talia remained affectionate toward her 'detective' but gave up on thoughts of a life together. Instead, she changed her focus toward charting her own destiny. |||| |||| She abandoned her father and, using the name Talia Head, accepted Lex Luthor's offer to run LexCorp when he took office as president of the United States. To seal the deal, she provided Lex with a disk containing details of her father's operations. Once she took over the conglomerate, Talia fed incriminating information about Luthor's operations to Superman and Batman, which helped lead to the president's downfall. She then sold off parts of the company to Wayne Enterprises. |||| |||| Talia returned to the family business when she was befriended by Nyssa, who proved to be her considerably older half sister, preserved, like their father, by the Lazarus Pits. Nyssa tortured Talia, killing and resurrecting her, using the moments of madness provided by a pit to turn Talia into her agent. In time, Talia located her fat er and finally killed him. Nyssa and Talia then assumed control of the League of Assassins. The changes hardened Talia's attitude toward Batman; she now opposed him more than allying herself with the Dark Knight. Additionally, after Batgirl killed Nyssa, Talia took control of the league, setting herself up as one of the most dangerous people on Earth. |||| |||| The five-foot-eight woman used her newfound position of Demon's Head to become a founding member of Lex Luthor's Society, a band of super villains dedicated to wiping out the planet's super heroes. She toured the world, recruiting members, punishing those who refused membership, and opposing the heroes whenever they turned up. After the events known as Infinite Crisis, Talia began her own schemes, which included obtaining Kirk Langstrom's Man-Bat formula and creating an army of man-bats. She intended to obtain weapons of mass destruction from the British military, sending her son Damian to distract Batman. In the end, Batman stopped the plan as Damian chose his mother over his father, and the pair seemingly died in an explosion. However, they survived the explosion, although her son was injured and required a transplant of his major organs."

He can merge with or absorb ordinary, existing water in his environment, often using it to increase his mass and volume. Bench's strength is slightly enhanced by his abnormal physiology. Recent alterations of his powers by the Wizard have enabled Bench to mentally manipulate water sources outside his own body, and have given him a finer degree of control over his own fluid form. However, the Wizard also intentionally weakened Bench's molecular cohesion, and developed a device enabling him to reduce Bench to an inert mass of liquid if necessary, ensuring Hydro-Man's loyalty.",,"Cargo ship crewman Morrie Bench was accidentally knocked overboard by Spider-Man (who was battling Sub-Mariner) during the testing of a powerful new experimental underwater generator, the energies of which combined with gases from undersea volcanoes to trigger a weird mutation in Bench, who began to transform into living water.

Sandman was so shaken that he went straight for years (until the Wizard brainwashed him into returning to crime), while Hydro-Man did most of his criminal work in groups from that point on, perhaps seeking safety in numbers. |||| |||| Both alone and as a member of teams like the Sinister Syndicate, the Frightful Four and the Assembly of Evil, Bench fought a wide array of foes such as Silver Sable, Sandman, the Fantastic Four, Cloak & Dagger, the Avengers, the New Warriors, Thunderstrike, the Thunderbolts, Gambit and Black Panther, but most often clashed with Spider-Man. Hydro-Man was one of many super-criminals employed by corrupt billionaire Justin Hammer for a time, and later served in the Masters of Evil assembled by Hammer's daughter Justine, alias the Crimson Cowl; however, after Justine's arrest and the apparent death of Justin, Hammer Industries phased out its criminal enterprises and Bench, along with fellow employee the Shocker, was laid off. The Shocker and Hydro-Man then teamed up for one last crime, seeking enough money to retire, but Hydro-Man's thirst for revenge against Spider-Man led to their defeat. Trying and failing to go straight, Bench was recruited back into the Wizard's Frightful Four and, more recently, the Sinister Twelve."

After it crashed on the North Pole, it sent out a message, to seek out the dominant life form on Earth. After an exhausting journey, Eshu finds the ship and is captured upon entering it. For thousands of years Eshu was experimented on by the Plodex ship. The experiments were excruciating. He was dissected and reassembled, just to be dissected again. He became more and more intelligent over the years he was experimented on until his mind and body were developed to the peak of perfection, and after some time learned to tap into the ship's systems with his mind, which eventually enables him to take them all over. He finds he is actually unable to leave the ship. He sends out a signal to a member of the Plodex race called Marrina. She responds and brings the superhero team Alpha Flight with her.

He would later become a member of the Injustice Gang which came into conflict with Hawkman and his allies, the Justice League of America. He lost the belt to the Phantom Stranger, but he gained a shadow suit. He eventually sold his soul to Neron for more power. Neron gave him a more powerful shadow suit with the ability to turn other people and objects into shadows. |||| |||| Recently, the Shadow-Thief has entered into the employ of St. Roch art trader Kristopher Roderic. Sands has been sent to the ends of the earth in service of Roderic's dark aims, and is hopeful that the unscrupulous collector will help him with a problem of his own. |||| |||| During the events of Identity Crisis, Shadow-Thief became deranged and began having delusional conversations with the Dimensiometer. He ended up apparently killing Firestorm with Shining Knight's mystically enhanced sword. For killing Firestorm, he was prosecuted by Kate Spencer (a.k.a. Manhunter IX). |||| |||| Shadow-Thief later popped up as a member of the Injustice League, and is one of the villains featured in Salvation Run"

He served for many cases until he was controlled by the Joker and resigned rather than face the shame.  He faded away for quite some time, resurfacing occasionally until the alien invasion happened.  He was one of a group kidnapped by aliens and tested for the meta-gene.  Turns out he had one.  He spend the next several years tooling around outer space.

388,"John 'J.' Jonah Jameson, Jr. (Marvel)",,388_20060504073417_char.jpg,,,"The step-son of an abusive veteran, Jameson began his journalism career as a paperboy, then copy boy for the Daily Bugle, formerly edited by old man Jameson, whom some presume to have been his father. A sullen and bullying student, he quit school after becoming a reporter. At twenty he uncovered police corruption by supposed department hero Sam Kenner; beaten and bombed, Jameson nonetheless exposed Kenner with the help of Bugle owner William Goodman. He became a full-time Bugle reporter, including a stint as a war correspondent, criticizing most costumed heroes as glory-seeking vigilantes upstaging the common man. Marrying his high school sweetheart Joan, Jameson rose to editor-in-chief and became renowned for supporting civil rights and opposing organized crime. When Goodman's heirs put the Bugle up for sale, Jameson tapped his last dollar and made the newspaper his own. He worked hard to support his wife and their son John, eventually becoming a millionaire member in New York's elite Century Club; although earning a reputation as a notorious miser, he supported many charities and often helped employees in true need. Still a reporter at heart, he ventured to Korea for a story but was crushed when Joan was killed by a masked gunman in his absence; this and other self-perceived failures contributed to his distrust of masked heroes and the heroic ideal. |||| |||| In recent years, when the superhuman performer Spider-Man became a crimefighter, Jameson vowed to expose him as a publicity-seeking scofflaw, and not even the rescue of John from a space flight disaster dissuaded him. He relied on photos from Peter Parker, not knowing he was employing Spider-Man himself. Jameson heralded the Spacemen as superior heroes, but this gambit failed when Spider-Man exposed them as criminals; support for Mysterio yielded similar results. Despite his many achievements, Jameson's harsh self-analysis weighed upon him, for his hatred of Spider-Man was motivated by fear that he was indeed the selfless hero Jameson could never be. Jameson hired Dr. Farley Stillwell to mutate investigator Mac Gargan into the Scorpion to defeat Spider-Man, but the debacle left Stillwell dead and the insane Scorpion hating Jameson. Plagued by guilt, the publisher confessed his actions to his friend Norman Osborn. Scientist Spencer Smythe soon offered Jameson the first of many Spider-Slayer robots, with which he battled Spider-Man to a standstill before the web-slinger escaped. Jameson rallied New York against the Kingpin's crime wave; abducted for his insolence, he remained defiant before being rescued by Spider-Man. |||| |||| Months later, Osborn, the Green Goblin, seemingly died in battle with Spider-Man; Jameson suspected Spider-Man of outright murder, hiring Luke Cage to bring the wall-crawler in, but desisted when John became the Man-Wolf. Jameson's obsession paled before concern for his son, but his own safety became an issue when he was attacked by the Grizzly, a violent wrestler he had blacklisted a decade before. Spider-Man rescued Jameson but chided him for the grudge; in response, Jameson hired Daniel Berkhart to harass Spider-Man as Mysterio's supposed ghost. When this failed, he contracted Farley Stillwell's brother Harlan to mutate a new operative, but fugitive Rick Deacon usurped the process and became the criminal Fly, killing Stillwell and becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and Jameson alike. Jameson mysteriously received photos depicting Spider-Man with the body of Peter Parker; the photos, sent by Osborn's drug-maddened son Harry, were actually of a clone. Jonah nevertheless kept them quiet but stepped up his traditional campaigns. He approached Dr. Marla Madison to construct her own Spider-Slayer but met no better success. Finally confronting Parker, whom he imagined had been slain and replaced by Spider-Man, Jameson believed his story of faked photography. His relationship with Madison turned romantic, and he proved his principles anew by denouncing the terrorists of the People's Liberation Front. The PLF responded by hiring the Hitman, but even in the face of death Jameson ridiculed his abductors, who were defeated by Spider-Man and the Punisher. |||| |||| Meanwhile, Smythe, whose obsession had outgrown even Jameson's, learned he was dying and resolved to take Jameson and Spider-Man with him to the grave. He mesmerized the Man-Wolf into abducting Jameson and fighting Spider-Man; Jameson believed John dead when he saw his son teleported away. Smythe suddenly shackled Jonah and Spider-Man with a bomb, dying afterward. Jameson broke down, admitting his obsession had harmed him far more than its subject, but Spider-Man deactivated the bomb, leaving Jameson devastated at his confession. Scientist Jonas Harrow targeted Jonah, driving him mad, but his tenacity challenged even Harrow, and after being rescued by Spider-Man, Jameson was soon his typically paranoid self. Months later, John resurfaced alive, barely remembering his extradimensional adventures, and Jameson was overjoyed with his son's cure. Longtime colleague Ian Fate resurfaced as a sorcerer in the company of the monstrous Man-Thing; naively expecting Jameson to help reshape the world, Fate lashed out when refused, but while Spider-Man fought the Man-Thing, Jameson calmed Fate and set him on a more peaceful path. Jameson himself returned to basics by investigating waterfront extortion, interrogating no less than the Kingpin and risking his life to uncover the perpetrators, albeit with unexpected assistance from Spider-Man. Perhaps in unconscious gratitude, Jameson's subsequent scheme to discredit Spider-Man with impostors proved half-hearted at best. |||| |||| The Hobgoblin, secretly Jameson's Century Club crony Roderick Kingsley, learned Osborn's secrets and tried to blackmail Jameson over the Scorpion's mutation. Spider-Man ended this scheme, but the conscience-stricken Jameson publicly revealed his guilt anyway, then married Marla Madison. Soon afterward, he hired the alleged mutant hunters X-Factor and the mercenary Wild Pack to bring in Spider-Man but, more at peace than he had been in years, he seemed content to restrict his castigations to the printed page. However, his vendetta literally took new form when the Chameleon imprisoned and impersonated him, bringing anti-Spider-Man sentiments to new heights. Inevitably rescued by Spider-Man, he found a new crisis awaiting him, for Thomas Fireheart, secretly the mercenary Puma, acquired the Bugle to build up Spider-Man's reputation. Jameson sought solace in his lifelong convictions, denigrating neo-Nazi Eric Hartmann in print; when Hartmann's forces invaded the Bugle, for once Jameson played the rescuer when he downed Hartmann before the madman could shoot the intervening Spider-Man. |||| |||| Fireheart eventually returned the Bugle to Jameson, but his control was wrested away by Norman Osborn, alive after all, but Jameson nonetheless investigated the mutant-hunting Operation: Zero Tolerance. Hoping to placate the publisher, the android-human Bastion offered him the outlaw X-Men's secrets, but Jameson refused, as his distaste for prejudice outweighed even his dislike of costumed heroes. The X-Men defeated Bastion, but Jameson was scarcely short of enemies when Osborn hired Daniel Berkhart, who had joined Mysterio's cousin Maguire Beck in the identity of Mad Jack, to force Jameson to sell the Bugle. Soon afterward, when Venom was ordered to put a scare into him, the madman mistook his instructions for a kill order, and even Jameson winced at the beating Spider-Man took in his defense. |||| |||| Jameson regained the Bugle when Osborn went mad in a mystic ritual, which also empowered teenager Mattie Franklin, who became a new Spider-Woman and was, ironically, entrusted to the care of the Jamesons. A different legacy hounded Jameson as Spencer Smythe's even madder son Alistair threatened Jameson's family before receiving his latest defeat. Berkhart and Beck, now Mysterio and Mad Jack, abducted Jameson but were outwitted by Spider-Man and Daredevil. Unencumbered by gratitude, he sought to capitalize on the revelation of Daredevil's secret identity but was undercut when reporter Ben Urich refused to participate. Jameson hired superhuman investigator Jessica Jones to break a similar story on Spider-Man, but Jones merely put his money to work for charity, making her later rescue of Mattie from drug dealers all the more biting. |||| |||| Even Jameson began to face his vendetta's futility, and his invective grew sparse. After fresh humiliation in a libel trial, he agreed to a new Bugle feature with a theoretically objective focus on super heroes, co-managed by Urich and Jones, but he was stunned by seeming proof that his son John had, inexplicably, been Spider-Man all along. Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man can only intensify when he inevitably learns the truth. |||| |||| Resigned from being a mayor in Superior Spider-Man #31."
36271,Cookie Malone,,36271_20140524193050_char.jpg,* Unarmed Combat,,"Cookie Malone is a Canadian cook who lived in the same mining camp as a young Wolverine. He is featured in the Origin series. |||| |||| After Rose and Logan arrived at the Alberta mining camp (where they were taking refuge after fleeing Logan's childhood home), Logan soon met Cookie Malone, an overweight cook who was being accused of keeping extra rations for himself while leaving the rest of the camp hungry.  These accusations of selfishness became apparently well-founded when,  in two different points of the series, he is shown to be robbing people's homes. |||| |||| Logan first ran into Cookie as a teenager.  Logan was having trouble handling a cart full of stone after its wheel hit a bump in the downhill road he was on.  Cookie ran up the hill to help him, only to turn on him and dump the stones over the side of the hill.  Logan and Cookie would have more confrontations, with Cookie bullying a submissive Logan. |||| |||| Eventually, Logan became very popular at the camp and Cookie was jealous of the attention.  To get back at Logan, he cut the dynamite fuses short.  This resulted in the tragic deaths of some workers, not including Logan.  Logan was trapped under the rubble, but survived due to his healing factor.  During the funeral for the workers who weren't as fortunate as Logan, the Canucklehead himself caught Cookie robbing a home in the camp.  This was the first time Logan was violent towards Cookie, and from here the tables turned. |||| |||| At the end of the Origin series, there is a cage fight tournament at the local pub and both Cookie and Logan enter.  They meet each other in the semi-finals and, aided by a crooked gambler, Cookie opens the bout with a metal-knuckled punch to Logan's head.  Cookie taunted Logan and was then beaten relentlessly, with Logan only barely sparing Cookie's life. |||| ||||"

199,Quicksilver (Marvel),Pietro Maximoff ,199_20070103021229_char.jpg,"Quicksilver possessed superhuman speed, and could travel on foot at speed exceeding the speed of sound for hundreds of miles before tiring; he could 'fly' for short distances by flapping his arms or 'vibrating' his legs; he could also use his speed to create cyclones, dodge machine gun and laser fire, and run up walls and across water. When the High Evolutionary's Isotope E upgraded his powers, he did not know the true limits of his speed. |||| Following the loss of his mutant nature, Quicksilver exposed himself to the Terrigen Mists, resulting in him now possessing the power to vibrate his atoms so quickly he travels forward in time. His molecular speed that he generates displaces him out of the mainstream time/space so that he is able to propel himself into the future. He can leap from an hour to up to twelve days, and remain for several minutes to several hours before being recalled to his present time once his body tires, or he can return at will before his time is up. As he returns from his trip, he returns the exact moment he left so as to appear that he has been gone for half a nano-second. He is able to bring inorganic objects from the future back to his correct time, although it has yet been shown what would happen if he attempted to bring organic objects with him. These new powers are having an affect on his physical health. Each time he meets up with his future self (if indeed the person he meets is his future self), the future self looks more and more haggard. |||| |||| After the incident on Genosha, Pietro continued to inhale the Mists of Terrigen and has apparently obtained the power, with the shards of the Mists in his hands, to restore other mutants powers.",,"Pietro and his twin sister, Wanda, were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple. As adolescents, Pietro and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the gypsy camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, living off the land. One day, Wanda accidentally caused a house to burst into flames with her uncontrollable hex powers, and the pair was chased by superstitious townspeople. Despite Pietro's attempt to defend her, the twins were soon overpowered and were rescued by Magneto (Magnus). |||| |||| Unwilling but believing they owned him a debt, the twins became members of Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. For months, they served in the Brotherhood, coming into conflict with the X-Men. When the extraterrestrial Stranger transported Magneto from Earth, the siblings left the Brotherhood. They learned the Avengers were seeking new members, and Quicksilver convinced his sister to leave for America and join the hero team. Alongside Captain America and Hawkeye, they remained with the Avengers for many years. They separated from the team only once, when Magneto manipulated Pietro and his sister into joining with him once again, but they soon realized the deception left. They then rejoined the Avengers during a conflict with the extra-dimensional Arkon. |||| |||| Eventually, Wanda began to become romantically involved with the Vision, and Pietro condemned her relationship with a pseudo-human android, causing their first major rift. The rift was later mended, some time after Wanda married the Vision, when the telepath Moondragon permanently altered Pietro's prejudice toward the Vision in a self-righteous employment of her powers. |||| |||| Pietro left the Avenges while the group was engaged in battle with the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Sustaining injuries in battle, Pietro was taken to medical care by Crystal, member of the Inhumans and whose dimension-spanning companion Lockjaw happened upon the scene of the battle. Months passed before Pietro was well enough to contact his companions to tell them of his circumstances. In the meantime, Pietro became romantically involved with his rescuer, and he and Crystal were married after a brief courtship. The wedding, held in the Inhuman city of Attilan, was attended by the Inhumans, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| The Golden Age hero Whizzer knew of the exploits of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, believing them to be his children whom he abandoned when his wife, Miss America, died in childbirth on Wundagore Mountain. Feeling guilty, however, he made no effort to contact them, until the day he sought the Avengers help in saving his other son, Nuklo. Wanda had come to believe the Whizzer was her father, but Pietro remained dubious. |||| |||| Months later, however, after being mystically abducted by Django Maximoff and freed by Avengers, Wanda and Pietro took a leave of absence from the team to investigate the secrets regarding their childhood origins. Returning to Wundagore Mountain, they met Bova and learned the truth of their parentage-- they were, in fact, the children of Magneto. His wife, the gypsy Magda, had fled from Magneto, terrified of the sudden manifestation of his power and intentions of world domination. Magda found her way to the tiny nation of Transia, finding refuge with Bova, a woman evolved from a cow by Wundagore’s High Evolutionary. Magda gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, with Bova as her midwife, but was still afraid of her husband, and left Bova her children. Several nights later, a vacationing couple (the Whizzer and Miss America in their civilian identities) also needed refuge as the wife midwife assistance. Unfortunately, the couple's child was stillborn, and Miss America died in childbirth. Bova hoped to award Magda’s children to him instead, but the Whizzer fled from Wundagore upon hearing of his wife's death, nearly insane with grief. Bova instead presented the twins to the High Evolutionary, who found Django and Marya Maximoff, a gypsy couple camped nearby who had lost their own twin children, Ana and Mateo, during World War II. They cared for the children as their own. |||| |||| Their abduction by Django also led to the revelation that Wanda held a connection to the demon Chthon, who was trapped within Wundagore Mountain and hoped to escape using Wanda as a host body someday. The return to the mountain allowed Chthon to possess Wanda, but she was soon freed by her brother, the Avengers, and Django Maximoff, who sealed Chthon inside Wundagore before dying. |||| |||| Pietro and Crystal soon had their own child, a daughter, Luna. Not long after, Pietro was confronted by Magneto who wanted to investigate his grandchild's birth. Pietro denounced Magneto for his callous treatment of them when they were members of this Brotherhood and refused to believe he and amended his megalomaniacal ways. Eventually, however, when Magneto appeared to be reforming, Pietro relented in his resentment for his natural father. |||| |||| Pietro had also volunteered his services to the head of the Inhumans’ small militia and became an officer. During his period of service, however, the Inhuman had no call for military activity. His neglect of his wife led her to become involved with another man. Learning of her infidelity, Pietro refused to forgive her and fled Attilan, vowing vengeance. He later tried unsuccessfully to frame the Avengers for treason, using the opportunity to attack the Avengers alongside the android Zodiac Cartel. He relented only after the Vision asked him if he was willing to orphan his and Wanda's infant children. Pietro later allied with the Hungarian government and assisted them in the development of techniques to create super-powered individuals. He proclaimed to believe fully in mutant supremacy and intended to rule the world as its self-proclaimed King of Mutants. He again tried to capture his Avengers teammates, but they escaped. |||| |||| +++ X-FACTOR +++ |||| |||| Distraught and addled, Pietro was accosted by the original X-Factor team, who were posing as mutant-hunters at the time. X-Factor helped restore Pietro to the Inhumans, whereupon it was discovered that his criminal insanity had been artificially inflicted by Maximus the Mad, who had been influencing Pietro's actions since he split with Crystal. Maximus was defeated and Pietro remained with the Inhumans. He secretly renewed alliance with Avengers, however, and publicly pretended to rejoin Magneto in order to watch over and influence his sister, Wanda, who had at the time gone mad and rejoined Magneto's service. With Avengers, he helped free Wanda from exploitation by Magneto and Immortus, restoring her to sanity. Pietro then remained alongside the Avengers for another long tenure, remaining estranged from Crystal and the Inhumans. |||| |||| Pietro later joined the U.S. government-sponsored X-Factor team, serving with the team throughout its public existence. At one point, during psychotherapy with Doc Samson, Pietro explained how his prickly personality stems largely from his frustration at dealing with a world where almost everyone and everything seems slow or stupid or both. When X-Factor was dropped from government sponsorship and forced to operate underground, Pietro left. |||| |||| When the Avengers were attacked by the alien Brethren, Pietro returned to aid the Avengers and found Crystal had also joined the team at the same time. Pietro refused to join the team since Crystal remained with them, although he later rejoined while participating in the rescue of his daughter Luna from Magneto's former Acolyte, Fabian Cortez, and his rival, Exodus. Pietro was gravely injured by Exodus and saved by the Avenger Black Knight, who by then was entertaining romantic intentions with Crystal. Recovering from his injuries at the Avengers Mansion, Pietro tried to win back Crystal. Ultimately, however, he began to repair his relationship with Crystal only after the Black Knight left Avengers. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Crystal and the other Avengers seemingly sacrificed themselves to stop the psychic menace of Onslaught. Pietro remained alongside the X-Men for a while before professing to wanting to track down other former Avengers. Instead, however, Pietro refused to join or to continue any form of the Avengers in retaliation from the government's anti-mutant legislation introduced in the wake of Onslaught. |||| |||| Again confronting Exodus and Magneto's Acolytes, Pietro joined the High Evolutionary in repelling their attack on Wundagore. Pietro was asked to become the leader of a small band of the Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore, animals that the geneticist had endowed with human intelligence and humanoid-like forms. Pietro accepted and exhibited an adeptness at leading the Knights in battles against injustice, although he soon left in order to find his true self. |||| |||| When the heroes who were believed dead returned to Earth, Pietro and Crystal were reunited. Both helped the Avenges reassemble and accepted the status of reserve members. Pietro would return to assist the Avengers on occasional missions. |||| |||| Not long afterward, Magneto was given control of the island nation of Genosha. Investigating his father's activities, Pietro was captured by resistance forces and would have been killed if not for the intervention of the X-Men Rogue and the former Acolyte Amelia Voght. After Magneto crushed the resistance, Pietro was ready to storm off when Voght teleported him to a Genoshan camp for those mutants infected with the Legacy Virus. Horrified, Pietro chose to stay in Genosha and act as his father's conscience, to remind him that both mutants and humans have to right not to be persecuted. He accepted a cabinet-level position in Magneto's new regime. This was all according to Magneto's plan, as he hoped to make Pietro into a loyal and subservient son. During his time with Magneto, Pietro was exposed to the mutagenic Isotope E, which boosted his powers to unforeseen levels. However, Pietro could no longer stomach his father's ruthless methods after witnessing him in battle against a Genoshan Resistance. He briefly warned the X-Men about Magneto and rejoined the Avengers. |||| |||| Recently, Wanda went mad, causing the deaths of Ant-Man, the Vision and Hawkeye, and though subdued, she remained a serious threat to the world. Quicksilver was shocked to find out that the Avengers and X-Men were deliberating over whether to kill his sister. |||| |||| Enraged, Quicksilver went to Genosha to find his sister, who had been taken into their father's care, and trying to make everything right, he convinced his sister to use her reality warping powers to make the 'House of M', an alternate reality where mutants ruled. Magneto and his family were the rulers of this new world, and everything seemed to be going well until some renegade heroes informed the royal family of how the world had been before. Magneto's anger caused him to slay Quicksilver who was brought back to life quickly by a distraught Scarlet Witch. Magneto seemed to have calmed her down when Quicksilver's sister changed reality back to it's previous state. However this time, blaming all her heartache on the powers she and her family possessed, the phrase she uttered to bring back reality removed millions of mutants' powers, Quicksilver included. |||| |||| Unable to cope with a world he felt was going too slow, Quicksilver went back to the Inhumans a wreck, and was convinced to use the Mists of Terrigen to gain powers once more. He succeeded in gaining new and fantastic powers and took his daughter Luna with him to Earth, via Lockjaw. There he took the stolen Mists and used them on Unus, Freakshow, Shola, Wicked, Callisto, and other de-powered mutants still living in Genosha. Soon he gave the de-powered mutants their powers back and encountered the Office of National Emergency and was teleported away once again by Lockjaw. However Pietro was not satisfied and continued to use the Mists which caused shards of the Mist to become imbedded in his hands which he used to give the Reaper his powers back. His next move is unknown."

She's also in possession of the 'canary cry', an ultrasonic blast of great power.",Older men.,"The current holder of the Black Canary mantle. Daughter of Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary. |||| |||| Dinah Lance was born into a family of crime fighters; her mother was a vigilante and her father is a cop. She grew up with the company of heroes, and after years of training, followed in her parent's footsteps by assuming the costume, identity and legacy of her mother Dinah Drake, the Black Canary. |||| |||| Post-Crisis she is the only one of the two Canaries to have had a relationship with Oliver Queen (the Green Arrow) - one that started when she was maybe 20 and he about 35. She was a founding member of the JLA and the Birds of Prey. Also, her mother, Dinah Drake Lance (Black Canary - 01) is dead. |||| |||| Pre-Crisis her history is a good deal more complicated. She's still the daughter of Black Canary (01), but she spent much of her formative years in the Thunderbolt's dimension.  Apparently, her sonic cry, as a baby, was so uncontrolled, that the only solution was to remove her entirely from the 'real' plane of existence.  While in this other dimension, though, she was kept maturing in a state of suspended animation. In order to keep the parents from worrying about their child, Johnny's Thunderbolt removed all knowledge from them that they had done any of this. They returned to Earth-2 believing that their child had died.  Years later, after Dinah Drake Lance had moved to Earth-1 when her husband died, Black Canary (01) became exposed to radiation that was killing her. Not knowing how to save her, Superman learned of Thunderbolt's earlier deception. Together, they decided to transfer Black Canary (01)'s life essence into the body of her daughter.  They also intrigued to keep this act of transference from Dinah once the process was complete. Thus, Black Canary (01) literally became her daughter. Green Arrow was similarly kept in the dark, though one wonders how he couldn't have noticed the difference between the two bodies in more 'intimate' moments. Perhaps he didn't have time to notice before the Crisis hit a short time thereafter."
244,Hourman (01 - Rex Tyler),Rex Tyler ,244_20051219000522_char.jpg,,,"Hourman was, in his civilian life, a scientist named Rex Tyler. Growing up in upstate New York, young Rex found an affinity for chemistry, particularly biochemistry. Working his way through college, he landed a job researching vitamins and hormone supplements at Bannermain Chemical. A series of discoveries and accidents led him to the 'miraculous vitamin' or Miraclo. He found that concentrated doses of that 'vitamin' given to test mice raised their strength and vitality several times that of normal. Taking a dose, Rex found that his strength, vitality, and speed increased to that of super-human levels. However, the human body could only process the Miraclo for an hour at a time. After that, the subject was weakened and returned to human strength levels. |||| |||| Keeping the discovery of Miraclo a secret, Tyler decided that human trials would be limited to the only subject he could trust: himself. Feeling that the Miraclo-induced abilities should be used for good purposes, he decided to use the abilities to help those that needed it; in other words, he would become a superhero. His first mission came as a result of Tyler's placing an ad stating that 'The Man of The Hour' would help those that needed it. Tracking down one respondent to the ad, he aided a housewife whose husband was falling in with the wrong crowd, and stopped a robbery. Using a costume he found in an abandoned costume shop, he started to adventure as The Hour-Man (later dropping the hyphen). In November 1940, Hourman became one of the founding members of the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America. After leaving the JSA in mid-1941, Tyler became one of Uncle Sam's initial group of Freedom Fighters. He later became part of the wartime All-Star Squadron. |||| |||| Hourman would be one of many heroes whose popularity would begin to decline in the post-war years. Eventually, his adventures ended. However, with the resurgence of super-heroes in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, interest in the Golden Age heroes returned, and Hourman was soon appearing as a guest star in issues of Justice League of America. Like all the other Golden Agers, he was now considered an elder statesman of the super-hero set. |||| |||| Unlike some other Golden Age heroes, his character would continue to grow more and more complex. The idea that Miraclo was addictive, combined with the suggestion that Tyler himself was addicted to crime fighting, made Hourman one of the superhero world's first cautionary tales. Rex would continue to fight both of his addictions throughout the rest of his appearances. His character was seemingly killed off along with other Golden Age heroes fighting a time-traveling villain named Extant. He was recently rescued from that fate by the third Hourman who took his place in that battle. Rex now lives in semi-retirement with his wife Wendi."

In particular, Bloodwynd has the ability to speak with the dead, and return them to haunt those who wronged them in life. Wears the so-called 'Blood Gem', as well as other gems, on his costume.  It is known that the Blood Gem, at least, gives him additional—if unspecified—mystical powers.",,"Bloodwynd is the descendant of slaves formerly owned by a man named Jacob Whitney.  Whitney himself was killed when the slaves created a magical stone called the Blood Gem and used it to murder the slaveholder.  What they did not realize was that the Blood Gem was a gateway to another dimension, and a demon by the name of Rott took possession of the souls killed by the stone's powers. |||| |||| Rott actually pulled Bloodwynd into the gem and forced the Martian Manhunter to wear it and impersonate the necromancer.  Blue Beetle figured out the deception during the battle with Doomsday when Bloodwynd was hurled into a fire that incapacitated him despite the fact that the real Bloodwynd had no vulnerability to heat or flames."

He drove to an army test site where experiments involving gamma bombs were being conducted. Dr. Bruce Banner, the designer of the gamma bombs, realized that the boy was on the testing field. He threw Rick to safety, absorbing the radiation himself. As a result of this, Banner transformed into the Hulk. Jones remained with the Hulk for some time, becoming a close friend. |||| |||| Rick was instrumental in the creation of the Avengers, as after the evil Loki took control of the Hulk, Rick was the person who sent out the radio call to assemble the heroes. |||| He later went on to become Captain America's sidekick. However, after some time Rick started to resent being on the side-lines, This was assuaged when he discovered a pair of alien bracelets that let him trade places with Captain Mar-vell, an imprisoned Kree warrior. |||| |||| After the death of Mar-vell, Jones returned to the side of the Hulk, and also briefly became an ally of the Galadorian spaceknight Rom. He later met and married Marlo Chandler. |||| |||| Jones later sacrificed himself to prevent the destruction of all reality, but was saved when he merged with the son of Mar-Vell, Genis-Vell. This created a new Captain Marvel."

605,Champion (Marvel),Tryco Slatterus ,605_20070125011702_char.jpg,"Tryco possesses the 'Power Primordial' like the other Elders, but he seems to have focused solely on his physical attributes. He is very strong (He has destroyed a planet with a single punch) and invulnerable. His abilities are further augmented by the Power Gem. Death has cursed Tryco as well as the other Elders with immortality.",,"Tryco Slatterus, formerly the Champion of the Universe, is one of the Elders of the Universe-individuals who are the sole survivors of their races, date to the earliest days of the cosmos, and have spent their lives dedicated to one focus, In the Champion's case, this focus was personal competition. Accompanied by fight promoters and trainers, for millennia the Champion traveled the cosmos and defeated the best fighters of each world in hand-to-hand combat, always stopping the battles short of death. Proja, his Promoter Supreme, preceded the Champion of Earth and recruited eight of Earth's strongest male heroes (Champion having decided eons earlier that females were inferior and not worth fighting). Champion then forced their participation by threatening to destroy the planet should they not fight him-those unworthy of the glorious gift that is the true spirit of competition would be 'purified'. The eight combatants accompanied Champion to his extra dimensional training facility, but only six ultimately fought him in a force-field protected Madison Square Garden: Thor, Hulk, Sasquatch, Colossus, Wonder Man, and the Thing. The Champion defeated or disqualified the first five within one round each, and then proceeded to brutalize the Thing, who refused to fall. Battered and bloodied, the Thing battled on for three rounds, until the Champion called the fight and claimed the victory. However, the Thing's persistence and refusal to accept defeat earned him the Champion's respect, and the Champion departed for his next bouts, telling the Thing that he would consider for him the supreme honor: a rematch. |||| |||| The Champion subsequently conspired with fellow Elders Astronomer, Collector, Contemplator (actually a Skrull imposter), Gardener, Grandmaster, Obliterator, Possessor, Runner, Trader and their ally Ego to vanquish the few beings older than them. The Elders claimed that their ultimate goal was to obliterate the entire universe, with themselves re-emerging in the new universe that would follow as the oldest beings in creation, each possessing as much power in that universe as Galactus currently did in theirs.. The Champion traveled to Earth to defeat the Silver Surfer, whom the elders saw as a threat, but the Surfer beat Champion by using the power cosmic instead of hand-to-hand combat. The Champion then claimed that he had come only to prevent the Surfer from interfering in a Skrull attempt at cosmic domination-the Skrulls had captured Galactus' then herald Nova (Frankie Raye) and were using her to blackmail Galactus into devouring worlds of their choice; access to this information allowed the Surfer to deduce a method to free himself from his imprisonment on Earth. Retrieved by his fellow Elders after this defeat, the Champion observed as the Grandmaster manipulated Earth's Avengers as part of a wager with Death, winning Death's permanent refusal of all the Elders into its realm as his prize. Champion then battled Mantis and the Surfer when they learned of and opposed the Elder's plans. |||| |||| The Champion soon traveled to Grinx and defeated the planet's ablest combatants, claiming as his prize their world-trophy, an Infinity Gem. The other Elders gathered the remaining Infinity Gems and created a solar system spanning Infinity matrix which allowed them to draw out the energy of its sun and six planets and use that to drain Galactus's life force. The Surfer and Nova interfered by exploding the system's sun, disrupting the Elder's scheme, and Galactus consumed Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner. Unable to die, the Elders survived inside Galactus, weakening him from within. When the Astronomer, Trader and Possessor allied with the In-Betweener to attempt to retrieve the five trapped Elders, the foursome attacked and defeated Galactus. Wanting Galactus dead (as part of a struggle against his own superiors, Master Chaos and Lord Order), the In-Betweener betrayed the three free Elders, confining them to Oblivion (disguised as Death by the In-Betweener). However, the Silver Surfer, Nova, Mr. Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman opposed the In-Betweener, saved Galactus. And inadvertently allowed the Elders trapped within Galactus, including Champion, to escape. Now free, the Elders each claimed an Infinity Gem, with the Champion taking the Infinity Gem of Power. They observed the battle which ensued between the In-Betweener and Galactus, intervening to see the In-Betweener banished back to the care of his masters as punishment in his role in condemning their three fellow Elders. When Galactus proved victorious, the Elders fled before the specter of his anger after their earlier attempt to kill him. |||| |||| Believing the Gem to be dormant and not wanting to attract the notice of Galactus, Death or Eternity, the Champion returned to his competitions. The Mad Titan Thanos found Slatterus on Tamarata, where the suddenly bloodthirsty Champion was engaging in mass battles instead of one-on-one fights, leaving many opponents dead on the field. Thanos tricked Slatterus into destroying the planet, and then offered to teleport the marooned Champion to another world in exchange for the 'dormant' Power Gem, a bargain he gladly accepted. Quickly conquering the simple dwellers on this new planet, the Champion obtained the foremost mystical artifacts of that world (wristlets which were apparently adaptations of the Quantum Bands), and then exterminated the planet's population before departing in search of both the Power Gem and revenge against its 'thief'. Champion eventually located the mad Titan, but when Thanos dismissively teleported Slatterus to a lifeless world, the Champion destroyed it in anger. Through the machinations of Mephisto (who was manipulating the Silver Surfer), the Champion soon learned that Thanos no longer held the Power Gem, and it was now in the hands of Drax the Destroyer. Slatterus attempted to head for Earth to find Drax but was opposed by the Surfer; Mephisto transported Drax to the field of battle and the Champion was defeated by the Silver Surfer and the Gem-powered Drax. The Surfer claimed and then destroyed the Champion's wristlets once he was defeated. |||| |||| The Power Gem passed through a number of hands (and universes) before the Champion finally recovered it and resumed his practice of seeking opponents. He settled in on planet Skardon, a planet where leadership was determined in hand-to-hand combat, and quickly became the planet's ruler. He then began running the planet into the ground, spreading word that he'd make the Skard suffer until a worthy challenger to his rule arose. Adam Warlock, who had experienced psychological difficulties himself while wielding the vampiric Soul Gem (another of the Infinity Gems), learned of the Champion's instability and used his Soul Gem to defeat Champion, but Skardon law did not allow them to acknowledge the out-of-ring defeat. |||| |||| While the Skardons aided the Champion in restoring himself after the defeat. Warlock sought opponents to defeat him within the ring. The Champion defeated the Shi'ar Gladiator, the Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Drax the Destroyer, and Adam Warlock himself before the Magistrati (agents of the Living Tribunal's universal law) sent a court-appointed advocate, the She-Hulk, to Skardon to oppose Champion at the request of Warlock's companion, Pip the Troll. Skardon law required Champion to accept even the challenge of a 'lesser' female, and She-Hulk was losing badly to Champion when she asked for an appeal and was granted an extension. She trained for three months on the theory that her human form of Jennifer Walters was weak, and by increasing her human strength, she'd exponentially increase her strength as She-Hulk. She then returned and objected to the Champion's use of the Power Gem, an alien object which should not be permissible within the ring according to Skardon law. The Champion, already irritated over the lengthy delay, angrily conceded the point and fought She-Hulk without it, and the pair even extended a bitter wager: if the Champion lost, he'd never wear the Gem again, and if the She-Hulk lost, she'd bear the Champion children for him to raise as future combatants. However, the Champion had apparently become dependent upon the Gem; that the She-Hulk's newly acquired bulk led to a quick defeat for the former Champion, reputedly his first ever defeat within the ring. He took the name 'Fallen One' and chose to provide the new 'Champion of the Universe' with worthy competition (and perhaps a little punishment as well). |||| Seeking out Zoma, a Watcher wishing vengeance on the She-Hulk on behalf of a banished friend, the Fallen One learned from him of She-Hulk's most ardent foe, Titania (Mary 'Skeeter' MacPherren) and gifted her with the Power Gem he'd agreed to surrender. The Fallen One trained Titania for several weeks in the American southwest until his new pupil, fearing Slatterus might take back the gem, dropped a small butte on him, burying him."

3253,Captain Marvel (Marvel)(02 - Monica Rambeau),Monica. Rambeau ,3253_20060413204229_char.jpg,"Pulsar can transform herself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum. Among the many energy forms she has assumed are cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, electricity, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves and neutrinos. She is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form, usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands; a variation of this ability enables her to project light-based holographic illusions. When she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Pulsar can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis, such as when she replicated and drained the verdant will-powered energies of an extra-dimensional emerald gladiator. Pulsar tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.",,"Monica Rambeau has always been devoted to serving and protecting the public, both as herself and in her various costumed guises. Before she became one of the brightest stars in the age of marvels, Monica Rambeau was a dedicated lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, partnered with the daring John Audain. Monica's life changed when old Rambeau family friend Professor Andre LeClare came to her for help; he had developed an other-dimensional energy-tapping device with financial support from South American dictator Ernesto Ramirez, who intended to use LeClare's technology to create incredibly dangerous weapons. Ramirez had already begun adapting the technology for his own purposes with the aid of scientist Felipe Picaro, but LeClare and Rambeau joined forces to destroy Picaro's prototype. In the process, Rambeau was bombarded by the device's extra-dimensional energies and gained the power to convert her own body into energy and back again at will. LeClare urged her to use this power as a crimefighter, and she left the harbor patrol to become a full-time adventurer. |||| |||| Dubbed Captain Marvel by the media, Rambeau sought out the Avengers for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training of their group. Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans Captain America and the Wasp, Monica soon graduated to full membership, serving a lengthy stint during which she became one of the team's most valuable and respected members. One early complication was the memory of an earlier Captain Marvel, the legendary alien warrior Mar-Vell, a deceased honorary member of the Avengers. Rambeau felt awkward about inheriting his title after she learned of his existence, but she retained the name since the Avengers and others regarded her as a worthy heir to Mar-Vell's heroic legacy. Another new Avengers recruit, Mar-Vell's close friend Starfox (Eros), disapproved of Monica using the Captain Marvel name at first; but even he was soon impressed by Monica's character and ability, giving her his blessing and saluting the new Captain Marvel. |||| |||| As an Avenger, Monica faced foes such as Maximus, the Enclave, Annihilus, the Lava Men (who mistook her for the divine Lady-of-Light of their legends), Morgan Le Fay, the Dire Wraiths, Maelstrom, the Skrulls, Kang, Attuma, Freedom Force, an insane Quicksilver, Tyrak, and Grandmaster's Legion of the Unliving, even battling an army of Earth's major super-criminals during the Beyonder's Secret Wars alongside many of Earth's foremost heroes. Two of Monica's earliest recurring enemies were super-powered psychiatrist Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who became one of Monica's bitterest foes, and Moonstone's powerful pawn Blackout (Marcus Daniels), who wielded the eerie Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in Project: PEGASUS. The pair would later return as members of Baron (Helmut) Zemo's Masters of Evil, participating in an occupation of Avengers Mansion and trapping Monica in the Darkforce dimension; but Captain Marvel escaped in time to help retake the Mansion during a series of skirmishes that left Moonstone temporarily crippled and Blackout dead. Another of Monica's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate Nebula, who shanghaied Monica into space for an extended period before she was reunited with the Avengers; but while Monica's adventures spanned space and time, she remained one of the most down-to-Earth Avengers. Her powers allowed her to make frequent visits to her native New Orleans, where she maintained a close and loving relationship with her parents. She even started a charter fishing business, eventually working on the water alongside her father, a retired firefighter and Monica's original heroic inspiration. |||| |||| When an exhausted Wasp stepped down as Avengers chairwoman, Captain America nominated Captain Marvel to replace her as team leader. Though she was overwhelmed at the prospect, Monica accepted the post and filled it quite capably at first, even seeing the team through a conflict with the Olympian gods; however, Monica became increasingly uneasy in her new role, a situation made worse after ambitious new recruit Doctor Druid began undermining her leadership. Finally, when honorary Avengers member Marrina transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature; during the battle that followed, Monica made contact with sea water while in her electrical form and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, depleting her energies so gravely and dispersing her atoms so widely that she could barely regain physical form, emerging as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers. Forced to retire from the team, Monica fought her way back to health and eventually regained her powers, though in a reduced and altered form that allowed her to surround herself with a manipulable energy field. She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crimelord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, Powderkeg, the Sons of the Serpent, the Blue Marvel and the alien Starblasters. At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business. Her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning after the alien Stranger helpfully accelerated the process. |||| |||| Monica has yet to return to the full-time Avengers roster, but has stayed connected with the team and served often as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an Atlantean invasion, opposed the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, chaired a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization, led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, played a key role in overthrowing the alternate reality tyranny of Morgan le Fay (Monica being one of only a few heroes whose sense of Avengers spirit was strong enough to overcome Morgan's mind-warping magic), battled the Wrecking Crew, advised troubled new recruit Triathlon, led an ad hoc squad of Avengers in saving the galaxy from relocation by the Infinites, helped contain Bloodwraith, fought Lord Templar & Pagan, faced the Triple-Evil, helped liberate Earth from the forces of Kang, battled The Order, assisted during the Scorpio crisis, and was one of many Avengers who confronted an insane Scarlet Witch. Rambeau also helped staff the Avengers' deep space monitoring station in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, being one of the few Avengers who could commute there with ease. For a time, Monica's mother was intercepting her Avengers calls since she feared for her daughter's safety and wanted Monica to spend more time with her ailing father, but Monica soon put a stop to her mother's meddling. Whether she will work with the newly reorganized Avengers at some point remains to be seen. |||| |||| When the late Mar-Vell's offspring Genis became an adventurer, he soon became known as Captain Marvel like his father before him-which Monica resented at first. After she and Genis teamed up to defeat the Controller, Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Monica since he felt she was more worthy of it; but Monica declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy, impulsively adopting a new costumed alias as Photon. More recently, Genis-physically and mentally transformed after a near-death experience and wanting to establish a new identity for himself distinct from his father-started calling himself Photon. Monica confronted him, tensely at first, but the two Photons ended up brainstorming super-hero names over coffee. Neither one of them wanted to become Captain Marvel again given all the baggage associated with the name, but Monica decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar. A hero by any name, Monica remains one of the most formidable adventurers of her generation. |||| |||| Recently Monica has taken up the leadership mantle of the rogue superhero squad Nextwave and played a stellar role in helping Black Panther, Luke Cage, Blade, and Brother Voodoo rid her native New Orleans of an infestation of vampires."

Much of the mentoring we saw Jonathan Kent (02) give to Superboy are, in current continuity,  lessons given from a mid 50s Jonathan to an adult Clark.  He's been given further definition in the current version by his contrast with Martha, who tends to be portrayed as a more modern, more free-thinking woman, with echoes of Lois and/or Chloe Sullivan. For maybe the first time since the character's original inception in 1939, he also has a role to play with other players in the broader DCU--not only (Kon-El) Superboy and both 21st century versions of Supergirl, but also some members of the Justice League.  Perhaps more so than his wife, Martha Kent (II), there is a very close relationship between his persona in comics and that of the actor playing him on the television series, Smallville .  It is unclear which way the causal arrow is pointing on this phenomenon though.  Is actor John Schneider secretly reading current comics for cues?  Are the Smallville writers, led by influential Superman writer, Jeph Loeb, simply giving Schneider scripts which offer a more direct translation of his comics counterpart?  Or are Superman writers and artists fans of Schneider's work and 'look'?  Whatever the case, the similarities between Smallville 's Jonathan Kent and DC's 'Jonathan Kent' have been increasingly close for the first half of the first decade of the 21st century."

He passed into the DCU following Charlton's sale to DC, and was an important part of the two Crises .  Undoubtedly, though, he will always be remembered for his greater role in the run-up to Infinite Crisis . Unlike the previous Blue Beetle, Dan Garrett, Ted was really not much more than a well-trained athlete, though he did have an exceptional mind.  He was, thus, a somewhat redundant character in the DCU, given the greater prominence of the similar Batman and Mr. Terrific.  His distinction was that he was possessed of a much lighter personality than these DC-created characters, and so tended to attract a unique following of his own, despite the sameness of his 'powers'.   He was a more realistic version of the character archetype, struggling with weight gain as he got older, and poking fun at his own lack of super powers when in the company of 'greater' heroes like Superman. He and Booster Gold formed an alliance while in JLA service that was used, with varying degrees of fan reception,  to illustrate what the JLA was like to those who were a little lower on the roster than Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and the Flash. DC, new outright owner of both Blue Beetle II and Blue Beetle III, would eventually show that there was a relationship between the two men.  Ted was shown to be a student of the archaeologist Dan Garrett.  When a crisis struck, caused by Ted's uncle and his army of androids, Ted and Dan went to battle against them.  Dan was killed by the threat, but, ostensibly impressed by Ted's willingness to do what was right even against the wishes of a close family member, Dan entrusted Ted with the legacy of the Blue Beetle.  Unfortunately, Garrett was unable to pass his empowering scarab onto Ted, so Kord was forced to find another way to uphold the mantle. |||| |||| Eventually, though, Kord did come into possession of the scarab, but the wizard Shazam took it from him in the 80-page story, Countdown to Infinite Crisis , just prior to Kord's now-famous death at the hands of Maxwell Lord. |||| |||| When Shazam himself was killed by The Spectre in Day of Vengeance many of his 'mystical trinkets' were shown to be scattered in the 'real' plane of existence.

1767,Taskmaster (Marvel),Tony Masters ,1767_20060523110651_char.jpg,"Taskmaster has photographic reflexes. By watching an action, he can execute that action perfectly. He can also, after much practice, mimic voices.",,"The man who would become the Taskmaster first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate the sophisticated rope tricks he had just watched the cowboy perform. Psychiatrists, called in at the mother's request, termed the boy's rare ability 'Photographic Reflexes'. He realized the limitations of his abilities the hard way by learning you must first learn how to swim before you learn how to dive as he nearly drowned. He employed his talent several times during his youth for professional gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted for becoming a criminal, which he perceived to be more lucrative. |||| |||| Taskmaster then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of a large number of superhumanly powered adventurers through archival television news broadcasts. He initially used his fighting skills to execute several successful grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish a center for training aspiring criminals to become polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world. Designing a costume, he took the name Taskmaster and began to train a large number of thugs at this criminal academy located near the town of Southampton on New York State's Long Island. |||| |||| It didn't take long for Taskmaster to get noticed by the criminal community and he was soon hired by the international terrorist organization known as Hydra to train Spider-Woman, who had become Hydra's latest operative. Taskmaster began to test Spider-Woman's powers and abilities until he thought she was ready to begin her true training in advanced martial arts to become a perfect weapon for Hydra. The training continued until Spider-Woman believed she was ready to be sent on assignment. |||| |||| When Spider-Woman failed her mission to kill Nick Fury and learned the truth about Hydra, she fled into hiding. Once Hydra was able to track her down, they sent Taskmaster in to bring her back. Underestimating her skills, Spider-Woman was able to defeat Taskmaster by stabbing him with a sword and using him as a conductor to channel her powers through to effect all Hydra agents surrounding them. |||| |||| This crime college was forced to cease operations when its front organization, the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane, was exposed by the Avengers. Taskmaster's chief business administrator, Dr. Pernell Solomon, afflicted with a serious heart condition, had forced the academies scientific staff to generate a clone of himself, with the purpose of using its heart for a compatible transplant. The clone, artificially aged to adulthood, escaped and alerted the Avengers to the existence of the criminal institute. Although the Avengers apprehended most of the Solomon Institute's personnel, Taskmaster managed to escape. |||| |||| Taskmaster established a new academy in a warehouse on Manhattan's lower west side, but the crime fighters Spider-Man and Ant-Man, following separate leads, discovered the place and thwarted Taskmaster's plan to rob nuclear material from a scientific supply house. Taskmaster was again forced to flee, claiming to have established technical institutes for criminals across the country. |||| |||| Taskmaster went into hiding and continued to train various recruits. During this time he trained and recruited Brock Rumlow and Blanche Sitznski to be instructors at one of his warehouse academies in Pennsylvania. Shortly afterwards Rachel Leighton and Sheoke Sanada would become members of Taskmaster's recruits to receive training at this location. |||| |||| Taskmaster was next observed at the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders, a small company that happened to have given Hawkeye his first job as an archer as a youth. Taskmaster was using the carnival as a traveling front for his operations until Hawkeye and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) compromised it. Again, the Taskmaster managed to escape custody. |||| |||| Taskmaster would later be hired by Black Abbott to recruit a group of street gangs from various neighborhoods together to train at one of his academies. This gathering would be interrupted by Spider-Man and Nomad. Already paid in full for recruiting the group, Taskmaster would soon flee instead of taking the chance at being captured. |||| |||| Taskmaster teamed up with Wizard, Constrictor and Deadpool to become the newest version of the Frightful Four. The Frightful Four attacked the Fantastic Four at their home located in the Baxter Building. The Thing and Franklin Richards where the only members there at the time. The Frightful Four captured the Thing, but Franklin Richards proved to be more trouble than planned. The Fantastic Four soon arrived home and Taskmaster, Wizard, and Constrictor would leave Deadpool behind to face the rest of the team alone. |||| |||| Deciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the Thing and Vance Astrovik assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster's activities. While escaping the Taskmaster was captured by a group of FBI agents and taken into custody, but there is reason to believe that the Red Skull was behind the Taskmaster's capture since a group of normal men were able to capture him. |||| |||| Sometime later, Justin Hammer hired Taskmaster to train a new Spymaster Taskmaster gathered a small group of his best students and put them through a rigorous program of training including a dangerous course as well against themselves until only one remained alive. The student known only as 'Number One' survived and deemed worthy of the name 'Spymaster'. Taskmaster charged the new Spymaster to retrieve the golden angel ornament from atop of the Christmas tree at Stark Enterprises as a field test in order to graduate before sending him to Justin Hammer. Iron Man decided to let Spymaster walk away with the prize instead of endangering the lives of children in the area. |||| |||| Taskmaster didn't take it too kindly when a student of his named Tyrone McQuaid decided to quit. Taskmaster sent other students of his out to kill him. Not knowing where to turn, Tyrone went to the local social services office in Harlem to find the Falcon. Tyrone told the Falcon the location of Taskmaster's academy where he was trained. The confrontation between Taskmaster and the Falcon didn't last long due to the interference of Tyrone and the Police. Taskmaster once again escaped capture. |||| |||| Through Douglas Rockwell, the head of the President's Commission on Superhuman Activities, Red Skull, who used the identity “Mr. Smith“, arranged for the Taskmaster to train John Walker to become the next Captain America in order to disgrace the image of Captain America. In order to conceal the Red Skull's involvement, Douglas Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster's sentence for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker to be the next Captain America for the Commission, the Red Skull had it arranged for the Taskmaster to escape from the Commission's detention center so he could continue training lackeys for the Red Skull. |||| |||| Taskmaster would next set up a new academy at an unknown graveyard mausoleum in Brooklyn, New York. Spider-Man believed Taskmaster to be responsible for kidnapping his wife Mary Jane and interrupted Taskmaster's plans while searching for her. Using his magnesium flare, Taskmaster managed to escape Spider-Man's wrath as well as capture. |||| |||| Shortly after Taskmaster’s arranged escape, the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) hired Taskmaster to train sparring partners for him in order to get his newly cloned body of Captain America in physical fighting shape for a confrontation with The Captain (Captain America, Steve Rogers) and Captain America (U.S. Agent, John Walker). It is also possible that Taskmaster even trained the Red Skull himself. |||| |||| A faction group of the Hand hired Taskmaster and Tombstone to kill numerous people for them. The Hand created a contest between the two as to who could kill the most according to rules set by the Hand. This lead to a confrontation with both Daredevil and the Punisher as well as between the two. Taskmaster was hit by a car during the battle between all four men. Punisher then tried attempted to throw a knife at Taskmaster's heart. Daredevil deflected the knife by shooting it using a gun and instead caused it to stab Taskmaster in the ribs. Taskmaster would be taken to the hospital by the paramedics. Daredevil would later pay Taskmaster a visit at the hospital as Matt Murdock to get information about the contest. Taskmaster asked if he was Daredevil and Matt Murdock replied indicating that Taskmaster was correct in knowing his secret identity. Taskmaster's face would be seen for the first time, but it is unknown if this was Taskmaster's true face or not and believed to be a holographic image. |||| |||| Taskmaster would next be seen as one of the Red Skull's (Johann Schmidt) Division Chiefs. The other Division Chiefs consisted of Watchdog Prime (Watchdogs), a Scourge, Crucible of the Resistants, Sin, Power Broker, Number Seven of the Secret Empire, Arnim Zola, Baron Von Strucker and Minister Blood. |||| |||| The Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) had Mother Night search for a replacement for Crossbones when he took a leave of absence from the Skeleton Crew. She found Cutthroat to be the best candidate for a replacement. In order to look good for the Red Skull, Mother Night told Taskmaster that the Red Skull himself put in a special request for a private training. |||| |||| Spider-Man's (Peter Parker) path crossed with the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) when he was searching for answers about his parents. The Red Skull contacted Taskmaster to take care of Spider-Man for him. Taskmaster seen this as an opportunity to try out new recruits he had trained to be versions of Captain America, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man himself. The anti-terrorist known as Solo was also searching for the Red Skull at the time. Spider-Man and Solo decided to team up together to find the Red Skull. Blood Spider, Deathshield and Jagged Bow were defeated due to Solo's interference. Taskmaster fled once again escaping capture. Taskmaster contacted the Red Skull afterwards to inform him of his failure to stop Spider-Man. The Red Skull told Taskmaster that he expected him to make up for it in full. |||| |||| The Chess Set contacted Taskmaster and other villains in order to sell energy saturated corpses of Silver, Auric and Hedison. This lead to a confrontation with Alpha Flight, Spider-Man and Wolverine. |||| |||| Taskmaster overheard discussion about restaurant grease worth half a million dollars while walking through the New York fair. Taskmaster decided to go after the grease only to find others after it as well. This lead to a confrontation with Daredevil, Stilt-Man, Tatterdemalion and Wild Boys. Taskmaster was unable to escape capture this time as the police arrested him along with the rest of the villains. |||| |||| When the Trapster took the Tinkerer to court for consumer fraud, Taskmaster was called as a witness on behalf of the Tinkerer. A fight erupted during the trial causing many super-villains to be captured, but Taskmaster once again escaped. |||| |||| After the Avengers and Ultraforce defeated Nemesis, Siren was transported into one of Taskmaster's academies. Taskmaster auditioned Siren for his school soon afterwards. When Diamondback appeared during the audition the two of them began to fight to prove themselves worthy to Taskmaster. Taskmaster informed them that he had a job for the both of them and assigned the two of them to kill the former Avenger War Machine, knowing that they would be unable to complete the mission. Taskmaster hid the true task from the two of them, which was that Taskmaster was hired by an unknown person to gather information on War Machine. Unknown to Siren and Diamondback, Taskmaster placed a device to record information on War Machine's new armor. Taskmaster misinformed the two of them that the mission was to kill War Machine so the two of them would test the armor in order to record the needed information. During Diamondback and Siren's mission a young boy by the name of Kyi stowed away on the quinjet in hopes of becoming one of Taskmaster's students. Taskmaster refused to allow a child into his academy until he found out that Kyi had potential and power of teleportation. Kyi would eventually take the name Jolt due to his powers. |||| |||| Taskmaster began to develop a relationship with Siren. Taskmaster soon found out that Diamondback double crossed him by planting explosive devices around his headquarters. Jolt accidentally started one of the devices when he removed one of the diamonds attached. Taskmaster had Jolt open a teleportation hole large enough for Siren, Jolt and himself to escape the explosion. During the journey through the portal Siren was sent back to her own dimension while Taskmaster and Jolt teleported to an unknown location. |||| |||| When a being from another universe entered the Earth-616 universe to learn how the universe was created, he met the Elders of the Universe known as Grandmaster. This universal traveler explained to Grandmaster that he planned on learning from this universe or would destroy it. Grandmaster talked the traveler into playing a cosmic chess game using the inhabitants of each other’s universe as their pawns. However, the traveler instead attempted to merge two cosmic universe together and enlisted the aid of many foes of both the Avengers and the other universe’s champions by mentally enthralling them to help his plans of universal domination. Taskmaster teamed with Shockwave, Whiplash, Crossbones, Zaran the Weapons Master, Tumbler, Razor-Fist, Machete, Conquest and a martial arts expert from the other universe to fight Black Widow, Black Panther and two caped urban knights from the other universe. It is unknown how long the battle took place, but it ended with Taskmaster’s team defeated. Once the Avengers and the other universe’s champions defeated the traveler, both universes and their inhabitants were returned to their rightful place in their respective universe. |||| |||| When the Avengers began to change their tactics to a more proactive stage and kept themselves updated on all major dangers at large to become more effective. They started by searching for Taskmaster in order to put a stop to his operations and denying criminals, terrorists and super-villains a valuable resource. However, Taskmaster continued to elude them with each academy they shut down. |||| |||| Due to the Avengers shutting down a vast majority of his academies, Taskmaster decided to make up his lost profit’s with more lucrative jobs and doing work-for-hire. One of his first job was to help out his old friend Jonesy in Las Vegas by stopping a small-time hustler that has been pulling a big-time scam at his casino. It took only three winning hands for Taskmaster to figure out the scam. On his way out of the casino Taskmaster met a woman by the name of Sandi Brandenberg, whom he decided to take a chance with and asked her out to dinner. |||| |||| The next day Taskmaster was hired by Sunset Bain to sabotage Stark Enterprises’ research and technology in developing a new semiconductor and put a stop to the Chinese Triads’ plan to steal the same technology. Taskmaster succeeded with the industrial sabotage of Stark Labs, but was confronted by Iron Man in the process. Knowing that he could not defeat Iron Man in hand-to-hand combat, he used his skills to evade and keep him off balanced enough to escape. When he went to claim his payment, he found himself set up by Sunset Bain. |||| |||| Sunset Bain’s betrayal did not go over too well with Taskmaster and he began planning payback. Using his skills he set Bain and the Chinese Triads against one another, making them believe each other had betrayed the other. However the Triad found out that it was Taskmaster that killed one of their members and not Sunset Bain. Sunset Bain and the Triad called a truce and allied with each other. The Triad’s first gesture of good faith offered to capture Taskmaster for Sunset Bain. The Triad managed to catch Taskmaster off guard and interrupted a date with Sandi. The Triad managed to capture Taskmaster and brought him to Sunset Bain only to be betrayed by her and killed by her men. Sunset Bain had her men torture Taskmaster within an inch of his life, stuffed into a weighted body bag and thrown off a bridge into a river. Using the skills he discovered while at a Buddhist school in Tibet, Taskmaster used meditation techniques to slow his breath and heart rate down, which allowed him to survive underwater for an extended period of time without oxygen, Taskmaster escaped and made his way to the surface. Knowing that he would need more experience in order to take on Sunset Bain’s entire group of henchmen, he began to watch kung-fu movies fast forwarded in order to move at a faster speed than normal. Using his new skills, Taskmaster stormed Sunset Bain’s New York office and easily made his way to a face to face confrontation with Sunset herself after defeating Sunset’s personal bodyguard Mr. Isley. Taskmaster was interrupted by a helicopter outside Sunset’s window before he could deliver a killing blow. While on his way out of her office he reminded Sunset that his vendetta against her wasn’t over. |||| |||| When the Superhuman Registration Act went into effect, Taskmaster reluctantly decided to help the government. Soon after, the Committee contracted Taskmaster to kill Moon Knight. The Profile told Taskmaster that Moon Knight would be friendless, alone, with no fight left in him and ready to die. Expecting this to be easy money, Taskmaster accepted the contract while also contacting the CSA about Moon Knight returning to being a costumed vigilante again. Unfortunately for Taskmaster, everything the Profile had told him was incorrect. While Mark Spector was indeed ready to die at one point, he received a sudden urge to continue living after one of his closest friends was nearly beaten to death. This lead to a short fight with Mark Spector and his friends, which resulted in Taskmaster being shot in the chest with a musket gun and falling out of a window. Upset over the fact that he was lied to, Taskmaster confronted the Committee demanding compensation for lost equipment and time. During this confrontation, Mark Spector flew his Mooncopter into the building, seeking vengeance. |||| |||| It is unknown how or when, but at some point Taskmaster was once again captured and like last time, was offered a deal to work off his sentence. Under the Fifty State Initiative, he joined the Thunderbolts who were now a group of villains working for the CSA in a work release program. Their assignment is to capture both renegade heroes and villains that have not registered. Not taking any chances, Mister Fantastic chipped and tagged each member with nanobot technology to monitor their actions. |||| Due to recent events, it is unknown if Taskmaster continues to train criminals at various academies across the United States. However as history has shown, once he is free again, he will continue his training of others so that he does not have to get personally involved in battle in order to make a profit."

645,Wrecker (Marvel)(03 - Dirk Garthwaite),Dirk Garthwaite ,645_20070907015840_char.jpg,"Having been transformed by Asgardian magic, the Wrecker originally possessed power that made him the equivalent of an Asgardian god—vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins. He later shared this enchantment with three others, sacrificing some of his own power but remaining none the less formidable.",,"Burt Garthwaite, construction worker and abusive father and husband, left his family when his son Dirk was at an early age (although his mother believed him to have later died and led her son to believe so as well). Dirk grew up filled with resentment and anger, becoming a laborer for a demolitions company, but he was fired for his disruptive and violent behavior. Turning to crime, he used a crowbar as a reminder of this father, destroying each place he robbed. Called the Wrecker, he managed to continually elude the police. |||| |||| One day, the Wrecker happened to attempt a robbery at a hotel room used by Loki, who was then stripped of his magical powers. Loki had just requested mystical enhancements from Karnilla the Norn Queen to oppose Thor. Karnilla cast the spell upon Dirk instead, since he was playfully trying on Loki’s hat. Flushed with his new superhuman power, he began a rampage in the city but was confronted by Thor. The battle raged for hours, but the Wrecker was eventually stopped by the Destroyer automaton, animated by the spirit of Sif. He was kept imprisoned under heavy sedation, but he eventually overcame the sedation to seek revenge. This time, Thor proved more than a match. The Wrecker was thrown against the third rail of a subway track, and Thor’s hammer was able to draw the Wrecker’s power away. |||| |||| While in prison, Dirk kept tabs on the location of his crowbar. With his fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin, Brian Calusky and Henry Camp, he managed to break out and retrieve the crowbar. Correctly assuming the crowbar housed the powers that had been drained from him, the Wrecker had his three friends grasp the bar with him in an electrical storm, and the storm transferred the power amongst the four of them. Franklin became Thunderball; Calusky became Piledriver; and Camp became Bulldozer. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and the Wrecker was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and the all-powerful Wrecker was brought down by Captain America. |||| |||| When Spider-Woman was on the trail of the Wrecker at large, Spider-Man also appeared to help. The heroes learned that nearly all of the Wrecker’s crimes were meant to fund his mother’s medical expenses, as she had laid bed-ridden for many years. Spider-Woman visited her, and she revealed that she never took his money, knowing where it came from and how he came about it. She interrupted Spider-Man and the Wrecker’s fight to show him a letter she had written moments before passing away, He read it and then left, distraught. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew, and they performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. Ultimately, Loki decided that he wanted the power of the Wrecker for himself, since it had been meant for him, and while the Crew were battling Thor and the Ghost Rider, he had the Enchantress and Ulik bring down each member of the Crew, until only the Wrecker remained. Loki proceeded to torture the Wrecker, and finally cast him into another dimension. |||| |||| The Wrecker found out how to appear on Earth during periods of concentration and sought out his long-lost father, Burt, who was discovered to be alive and living in a retirement home. Thunderstrike and Code: Blue managed to track the Wrecker and arranged a trap for him at his fathers’. During the encounter, Burt continued to browbeat his son and, suddenly, suffered a heart attack. The Wrecker was denied his change of revenge and snapped back to his exile. |||| |||| The Wrecker somehow finally returned to Earth and was reunited with the Crew, but their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. Leaving the Crew to find the source of his fading powers, he found the god Set, who beat him so severely as to remand him to the hospital. Later, the entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). Although this power boost was successful, it was based on science, not magic, and the Wrecker came to believe later that he lost the “edge” Asgardian power gave him. |||| |||| Once again, the Wrecking Crew appeared as a whole in their subsequent endeavors, hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan le Fay, among others. When the Crew was imprisoned in the Raft, they joined the massive breakout and escaped, but the Wrecker was apart from the Crew when he was recaptured by a new version of the Avengers."

Years later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania, but the villagers there turned against him and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation. A local, Baron Hugo, told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to the Thing to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human, and in exchange for Ben’s services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. |||| |||| |||| When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the four were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemical chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, Mister Fantastic discovered that Diablo’s chemicals worked, but only for a short while before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemical powers to conquer the planet. |||| |||| |||| But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo’s fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball and threw it after the alchemist. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo’s prison. |||| |||| |||| But Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted, stone prison, and escape to revenge himself upon the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, Dragon Man. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time. Diablo was also later responsible for the destruction of their pen-ultimate headquarters, Pier 4."

Can form force field barriers effective against energy attacks, mentally produce heat and mental blasts of pure psionic energy, probe the minds of others, and recall any fact he has ever known. He can also convert himself into raw data and travel in the form of e-mail.",Love.,"Average technician George Tarleton found his fate forever changed thanks to a random selection by his boss, the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M., who needed a unique, bio-engineered 'living computer' in order to plumb the mysteries of the Cosmic Cube. Tarleton was subjected to hideous experiments, mutating his body into a massive-headed being possessing superhuman intelligence and extraordinary psionic powers, and the process drove him mad. Given the code-name MODOC ('Mobile Organism Designed Only for Computing'), Tarleton instead turned on his superiors, slaying them all and declaring himself Scientist Supreme. Moreover, he changed his name to MODOK, with the 'K'� standing now for 'Killing'.� |||| |||| Knowing only the barest of information, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent its Agent 13 to gather intelligence about A.I.M. and MODOK, but she was captured and Captain America was then sent to the rescue. The two heroes were captured, but ultimately discovered MODOK when he revealed himself and tried to kill them personally. During the resultant clash, other A.I.M. agents, those opposed to MODOK's leadership, turned on him and allowed Captain America and Agent 13 to escape. The submarine base destroyed, MODOK was believed dead, although he used his psionic abilities to save himself and soon reasserted his leadership over A.I.M. |||| |||| Initially, MODOK turned A.I.M.'s pursuits toward acquiring technology and new recruits, running into conflict with Captain America, Doctor Doom and the Sub-Mariner, and the Hulk. During the latter confrontation, MODOK first used a giant robot body in a preemptive strike on the Hulk, and later he mutated Betty Ross into the Harpy to defeat him (although MODOK was stopped by the arrival of the Bird People.) MODOK used his giant body to confront Iron Man, capturing him but being defeated by the Yellow Claw. |||| |||| Following this defeat, MODOK was deposed as leader of A.I.M., as his followers were dissatisfied with MODOK's increasing preoccupation with his super-powered adversaries causing A.I.M. to largely abandon its goals for scientific breakthroughs. However, MODOK regained control of a West Coast faction of A.I.M. and, in alliance with Deathbird, he led A.I.M. in an attack on its East Coast division. Still, a considerable portion of the A.I.M. organization remained outside of MODOK's control. MODOK did not realize that the members of A.I.M. whom he believed were securely under his control were secretly conspiring with the other faction of A.I.M. to destroy him. To his surprise, both A.I.M. groups joined forces and attacked him. MODOK retreated, soon afterward fighting A.I.M. forces alongside the Hulk, but he finally fled after battling the Hulk himself. With MODOK gone, all of A.I.M. was finally reunited under new leadership. |||| |||| The new leaders of A.I.M. hired the Serpent Society to assassinate MODOK to prevent him from posing any further threat to them. MODOK had escaped capture, ultimately hiding in a warehouse at a shopping mall in Newbury, New Jersey, but he was followed by both the Serpent Society and Captain America. Captain America found the weakened MODOK as two of the Serpents, Cottonmouth and Death Adder, were tearing away at his flesh. MODOK died even as Captain America was trying to help him, and the Serpents delivered his corpse back to A.I.M. |||| |||| A.I.M. managed to keep MODOK's body for use as a living computer, similar to his intended origin, but A.I.M. agent Yorgon Tykkio sent MODOK into battle against Iron Man, guiding him by remote control. At the height of battle, however, Tykkio caused MODOK's headband to fire plasma that ignited underground fuel lines, causing an explosion that ultimately annihilated MODOK's body. |||| |||| Years later, A.I.M. once again sought the control of the Cosmic Cube, and in so doing they tore reality itself. Using the Cube, they restored MODOK to life, hoping that he could command the energies to fix reality. Although it was actually an Adaptoid that saved the day, MODOK took advantage to resume leadership of A.I.M. once more. |||| |||| He returned to his preoccupation with his rivals, battling Captain America and Iron Man, but he also explored new avenues for A.I.M., such as exploring the relationship of science and magic (running afoul of Alpha Flight for reviving their member Snowbird), allying with Hydra over nanotechnology (before taken down by Citizen V and the V-Battalion), and creating a legitimate corporate front for A.I.M. as Advanced Corp. (until exposed by Iron Man.) MODOK was once saved by the Headmen from where he had lost himself in an extra-dimensional quest for additional power. In gratitude, he agreed to join them in their hopes of taking over the world, helping them do so with the help of the alien Orrgo. MODOK admitted, however, that this association was merely scientific, as he examined the efforts of the Headmen to better understand himself, and he and A.I.M. disassociated themselves from the Headmen before the villains were thwarted by the Defenders. |||| In a strange series of events, MODOK appeared to be hunting down and killing all A.I.M. agents responsible for his original transformation. In fact, MODOK had switched bodies with Damocles 'the Saint'� Rivas, the brother of a drug lord who developed a viral bio-weapon using MODOK's DNA, and Damocles was acting on MODOK's long-suppressed hatred of his form. MODOK had hoped to use Rivas to claim the scheme for himself, but ran afoul of the Falcon and the Anti-Cap. His defeat sent his mind back into his body, where it co-existed with Damocles. Damocles instead hoped to engage the Hulk in battle and thereby destroy MODOKâ€™s form, but Captain America intervened, inspiring Damocles to use MODOK's mental powers to revert the Hulk to Bruce Banner and gain his help to cure the MODOK virus. MODOK was rendered comatose, but he soon reverted to normal to once more lead A.I.M., with all traces of Damocles Rivas expunged."

150,"Nick Fury (Marvel)(01 - Nick Fury, Sr.)",,150_20060721202100_char.jpg,"Slowed aging process, provided by the Infinity Formula.",,"Nicholas Joseph Fury is the son of noted World War I pilot Jack Fury and an alleged descendant of one of the men who wore the Phantom Rider mask in the late nineteenth century. He was born in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in the late 1910s. Following high school, Fury and his longtime friend Red Hargrove joined Finley's Flying Circus, a traveling air show. They both became excellent pilots and stuntmen. When Finley's Flying Circus came to England in 1940, Fury and Hargrove gave parachuting instructions to Lt. Sam Sawyer, an American soldier attached to the British Army. Weeks later, Sawyer was assigned to rescue a British spy in Holland, and he persuaded Fury and Hargrove to accompany him. Their plane was downed in Holland, where they met circus strongman Timothy 'Dum-Dum' Dugan, who joined their rescue mission. In the end, all five safely returned to England. Inspired by the adventure, Dugan joined the British Army, and in early 1941 Fury and Hargrove returned to America to enlist in the U.S. Army. |||| |||| Fury and Hargrove were soon stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, where Fury rapidly rose to sergeant. On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese and Hargrove was slain. When America declared war on the Axis, Sawyer, now a captain, was reassigned to the U.S. Rangers and instructed to form the First Attack Squad, a special squad of rangers trained in military precision but using individually developed combat techniques. Given virtual carte blanche to handpick Squad members, Sawyer took pains to have Fury appointed field commander. Other recruits included Dugan, black jazz trumpeter Gabe Jones, mechanical expert Izzy Cohen, actor Dino Manelli, lasso-wielding Reb Ralston, and college student Junior Juniper. The Squad members were made honorary commandos in the British army and codenamed 'the Howling Commandos,' or 'Howlers.' Other units under Sawyer's command during the war included Sgt. Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Sgt. Bob Jenkins's Missouri Marauders, Jim Morita's Nisei Squadron, and Combat Kelly's Deadly Dozen. |||| |||| For nearly four years Fury led the Howlers on combat and intelligence missions in virtually every recognized theater of war (and a few more besides). When Juniper was slain in an early mission, he was replaced by eccentric British soldier Pinky Pinkerton; German defector Eric Koenig joined soon afterward, establishing the core membership the Howlers would retain for the remainder of the war, although other soldiers came and went over time. His left eye injured by an enemy grenade, Fury received a Purple Heart but did not leave military service, eventually regaining sight in that eye. The Howlers clashed with many high-ranking German officers, most notably Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. The Howlers proved so successful that Strucker was ordered to form a similar unit, the Blitzkrieg Squad, but the Howlers always triumphed over their counterparts. Occasional allies of the Howlers included other Sawyer-commanded units, the Marines of Captain Simon Savage's Leatherneck Raiders, and the costumed adventurers Captain America and Bucky. At some point, Fury befriended a Canadian soldier named Logan, secretly a superhuman mutant. |||| |||| Early in the war, separated from the Howlers during a mission in France, Fury was gravely injured by a land mine. Discovered by French partisans, he was taken to a nearby doctor, Professor Berthold Sternberg. Unknown to Fury, Sternberg not only treated Fury's injuries, but also surgically altered Fury so he could withstand inoculation with Sternberg's so-called 'Infinity Formula,' intended to slow or even halt the human aging process. Fury returned to his unit a week later, still unaware of Sternberg's experiment; however, over the course of the war, exposure to Fury's blood introduced the formula into the other Howlers' bloodstreams as well, causing them to remain unusually vital well into old age. Fury returned to France many times during the war, occasionally on intelligence missions from the Office of Strategic Service. |||| |||| Weeks after the unit's formation, the Howlers were assigned to destroy a death ray created by Baron Heinrich Zemo, who destroyed it himself rather than risk its falling into enemy hands; Zemo later became a notorious enemy of Captain America. In mid-1942, while stationed in London, Fury fell in love with Lady Pamela Hawley, a British noblewoman serving in a London ambulance unit. In July of that same year, the Howlers ventured into Romania and met the infamous vampire Dracula, who proved as averse to Nazis as they were. However, the vampiric Nazi agent Baron Blood would later capture the Howlers, though his plans fell apart when an American soldier that he vampirized turned against him. In late 1942, the Howlers were assigned to North Africa, where they saw action alongside nomad leader Desert Hawk and his daughter Sheila, Captain Starr and the Marines of Item Company, and infantryman Combat Casey, among others. |||| |||| In 1943, Fury and Dugan rescued Pam Hawley from the German sorcerer Viscount Krowler, unwittingly intervening in a time-transcending clash between the demonic Dormammu and future Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who removed the soldiers' memories of the proceedings. The Howlers faced more magic weeks later when they teamed with adventurous thief Jean Luc LeBeau to keep Baron Strucker from obtaining the time-traveling gem called the Momentary Princess. On a more prosaic note, Fury at last decided to propose marriage to Hawley, but she perished tragically during a London air raid, killed by the raid's final bomb as she was helping the wounded. Months later, when Fury was home on leave, his brother Jake, jealous of Nick's fame, was abducted by the Nazi Colonel Klaue. Nick freed Jake but was captured himself, and Jake helped the Howlers rescue Nick. Following these events, Jake enlisted in the army; he soon regretted his choice, and his resentment of Nick grew. |||| |||| At some point the Nazi mastermind Red Skull infiltrated Fury's base in disguise, though circumstances foiled his mission. In April 1944, the Howlers fought the Skull directly alongside Captain America and Bucky, rescuing an American industrialist. Weeks later, the Howlers pursued Baron Strucker to the German village of Gruenstadt, where they saw him lead a Nazi S.S. Squad in massacring Gruenstadt's entire population. Outraged, the Howlers gunned down Strucker's soldiers to the last man, although Strucker himself escaped. Fury did not know it at the time, but Strucker destroyed Gruenstadt to conceal the nearby discovery of a party of Gnobians, extraterrestrials with vastly advanced technology. After the massacre, Strucker mindlinked with the Gnobian leader, gaining extensive alien knowledge--though he later disputed this--while the Gnobians were infected with his own twisted personality. |||| |||| On June 6, 1944, a.k.a. D-Day, the Howlers were part of the Allied invasion of Nazi-held France. In October they teamed with Captain America and Bucky to face a far different invasion, helping the contemporary Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, against an alliance between Dormammu and the Red Skull; once more, sorcery removed memories of Dormammu from Fury and company. Returning to more conventional warfare, Fury and Cap destroyed one of the Red Skull's biochemical warfare camps weeks later, freeing airman Michael Kramer and other prisoners. The Howlers were also among the Allied forces who halted German advances in the Battle of the Bulge in the last days of 1944. In 1945, the Howlers had yet another brush with the unworldly in Berlin, where centuries-old sorcerer Algernon Crowe was creating zombie soldiers for the Nazis. The Howlers incapacitated the zombies and torched Crowe's facility, believing Crowe to be dead. |||| |||| When the war finally ended in August 1945, Fury led the Howlers on European 'mop-up' missions against remaining Axis operatives. It was during this period that the Howlers shut down the death camp laboratories of Nathaniel Essex, a.k.a. Mister Sinister. Fury was then reassigned to Okinawa, Japan to shut down remnants there, while the other Howlers returned to civilian life. |||| |||| Fury was soon recruited by the O.S.S. full-time. Working with agents of the British MI-5, he was sent after Colonel Ishii, a renegade Japanese scientist with a cache of bio-weapons; Fury captured Ishii, but was the mission's only survivor. In 1946, Fury aged sixty years in minutes due to long-term effects of Sternberg's Infinity Formula; Sternberg, having anticipated this, had mailed Fury a mutated version of the formula, and Fury immediately inoculated himself with it, restoring his youth. However, the effect lasted only one year, and Sternberg began extorting money from Fury in exchange for a yearly supply of the formula. Unable to locate Sternberg, Fury acquiesced and bought doses from him for the next several decades. |||| |||| When the O.S.S. disbanded in 1947, Fury was reassigned to Army Intelligence and eventually saw action in the Korean War, which began in 1950; at some point, Fury re-formed the Howling Commandos, who re-enlisted for a special mission to blow up a missile base behind enemy lines. At the successful close of this mission, Fury was promoted to second lieutenant and soon afterward transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency. In this capacity, he led a unit known as Team Valkyrie until the war's end in 1953. At some point in the late 1950s or early 1960s, Fury worked with the super-team called the First Line and was particularly impressed by their leader, Yankee Clipper. By 1963, Fury was a C.I.A. colonel in charge of a program involving telepathic operatives, one of whom, Theresa Bellwether, was murdered as part of a defense operation called Project: About Face. The ultimate fate of Fury's program is unrevealed, but by 1967 he was active in the Vietnam War, where he again re-formed the Howling Commandos as volunteers on special assignment; a year later, he underwent training in the Green Beret Special Forces, which he followed up with Black Beret training in 1973. Little else is known of Fury's C.I.A. activities, although during this period he frequently worked with his wartime comrade Logan, now a Canadian intelligence operative. Fury's tactics and talents earned him many rivals, including a deadly intelligence operative known only as the Spook. |||| |||| In the early 1980s, Fury investigated a reorganized First Line and aided them against subterranean invaders; following his report, he was recommended for 'Project S.H.I.E.L.D.,' a government operation still many years from completion. Later, Fury went undercover in Macao to investigate Amber D'Alexis, who ran an espionage and weapons smuggling ring out of her casino; Fury romanced D'Alexis to win her confidence, only to learn that she was romantically involved with his brother Jake, now a biophysics researcher. Fury ultimately took D'Alexis into custody, and Jake's resentment turned into hatred. A few years later, Fury re-formed the Howling Commandos at least once more, for a mission with pilot Ben Grimm. During the same time frame, Fury worked with two brilliant scientists, Reed Richards and Tony Stark; unknown to Fury, both men were involved in Project S.H.I.E.L.D., and Jake Fury soon became a Stark employee. |||| |||| In recent years, not long after the debut of the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury aided the team against the subversive Hate-Monger. Following this mission, Fury was assigned to investigate a spy at Stark International, unaware that Stark himself was involved in the new international espionage unit known as S.H.I.E.L.D. (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division), the finalized version of Project: S.H.I.E.L.D., whose director, Colonel Rick Stoner, had recently been slain by the high-tech terrorists Hydra. Fury was dismayed to discover that the spy was his brother Jake, who had defected to Hydra. Confronting his brother, Fury was shot in the left eye, exacerbating his old war injury. Though his operations were exposed, Jake escaped, and Nick, his left eye now almost totally useless, began wearing an eyepatch. Shortly afterward, a mission in Russia again teamed him with Logan, now the Canadian super-agent Wolverine. |||| |||| Returning to America, Fury was, at Stark's recommendation, recruited to head S.H.I.E.L.D., which was facing renewed attacks from Hydra. Fury was dubious of his own qualifications but accepted the role, soon recruiting Dum-Dum Dugan, who became his second-in-command, as well as Gabe Jones and Eric Koenig. Fury led S.H.I.E.L.D. against Hydra, A.I.M., the Druid, and other terrorists; never one to risk subordinates' lives on jobs he could do himself, Fury continued to act as a field agent. His right-hand man was Jasper Sitwell, a loyal administrator whose dedication to the rules irked Fury almost as much as it grounded him, while much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s developing technology was overseen by Sidney 'the Gaffer' Levine, a brilliant inventor and, like Fury, a veteran of a wartime unit, in his case the high-tech Skywolves. During his early clashes with Hydra, Fury fell in love with Laura Brown, daughter of the organization's supposed leader, the Imperial Hydra; when the Imperial Hydra was slain in one clash, Fury believed Hydra was on its last legs, but its creed of 'cut off one arm and another shall take its place' would soon prove itself true. When Fury's relationship with Brown ended, he began romancing fellow agent Contessa Valentina de Fontaine. |||| |||| Mere months after joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury was reunited with his wartime friend Captain America, who had been revived from decades of suspended animation by the Avengers. Ironically, Fury faced a more unhappy reunion when he learned that Hydra, founded in the closing days of World War II, was secretly led by none other than Baron Strucker, who tried to blackmail the world with a so-called Death-Spore bomb; however, Fury located the bomb and sealed it in Hydra's domed island base, where it apparently killed only Strucker and his men. On the heels of this victory, Fury was almost driven mad when he became a pawn in a game between Latverian dictator Doctor Doom and his robot opponent, the Prime Mover. In the course of the game, S.H.I.E.L.D. clashed with a robot of the megalomaniacal Yellow Claw, and when the true Claw's nemesis, FBI agent Jimmy Woo, became involved in the proceedings, Fury recruited him for S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| |||| Another foe resurfaced when Jake Fury, empowered by the mysterious Zodiac Key, attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. as Scorpio; eventually exposed, Scorpio clashed with Fury repeatedly until his apparent death, although his consciousness survived in an android body. A final bit of Fury's past was laid to rest when Professor Sternberg was slain by criminal Steel Harris, who attempted to up the extortion on Fury's supply of the Infinity Formula; however, with the help of de la Fontaine, Fury defeated Steel and obtained the secrets of the Infinity Formula for himself. |||| |||| |||| As S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury fought various superhuman foes alongside New York's super heroes, many of whom he befriended. When the Thing and a handful of Avengers organized a floating poker game, Fury became a regular participant; at one such game he renewed his friendship with Wolverine, now a member of the mutant X-Men. Despite his respect for super heroes, Fury recognized them as potential loose cannons, and S.H.I.E.L.D. formed more than one contingency plan against them. For years, Fury balanced his duties against his friendships, not always to his own satisfaction. As S.H.I.E.L.D.'s influence spread, Fury became concerned about internal corruption and worked with ex-agent Mockingbird to expose several criminal operations. Fury became the target of the seven-section organization the Sept, who attacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s airborne Helicarrier base, overthrew a small Latin American government, attacked Fury and his men in Egypt, and were tracked to Hong Kong, where Fury unmasked their leader, the One, as the true Yellow Claw. A few years later, while investigating use of the Zodiac Key, Fury was stunned to meet a new Scorpio named Mikel Fury, who claimed to be Jake Fury's son by Amber D'Alexis. Working alongside Wolverine, Fury shut down D'Alexis's latest criminal operation, but D'Alexis herself held Fury at gunpoint and revealed that Nick, not Jake, was Mikel's father. D'Alexis was defeated by Wolverine shortly afterward, and Fury took Mikel into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, although he soon escaped. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Fury learned that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by artificial life-forms called Deltites, who deceived most of Fury's agents, including de la Fontaine, into turning against him. Fury and a handful of loyal agents eventually defeated the Deltites, but not before almost all remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were seemingly slain; unknown to Fury, the Deltites had been directed by Baron Strucker, alive after all, who kept the supposedly dead agents in stasis. S.H.I.E.L.D. was formally disbanded, and Fury traveled the world to close S.H.I.E.L.D.'s bases and destroy its most dangerous technology. Physically and emotionally exhausted, Fury briefly retired in the company of agent Kate Neville, who became his lover. |||| |||| Months later, Fury left retirement to join de la Fontaine, Neville, and others against the Death's Head Guard, Gnobians altered by former Nazi geneticist Arnim Zola and driven by Strucker's hatred of Fury. The Guard slew hundreds of American agents before Fury managed to break through their programming, after which they committed mass suicide; Strucker later implied that the aliens were in fact creations of Hydra, but this claim seems dubious given the Gnobians' wartime activities. Soon afterward, a new S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate), designed to be less vulnerable to corruption, was formed, and Fury became its director. Under Fury, the new S.H.I.E.L.D. renewed ties with the superhuman community and faced enemies both new and old, including Algernon Crowe, one of the leaders of Mys-Tech, which combined science and magic in pursuit of conquest. Investigating Mys-Tech's greatest threat, the reality-altering Un-Earth, Fury was slain by Crowe, only to be resurrected when American and British super heroes reversed time to defeat Mys-Tech. Fury later teamed with the United Kingdom's Super-Soldiers against Hydra's Warlord Huang Zhu in the Savage Land. |||| |||| Despite the new S.H.I.E.L.D.'s early successes, tragedy again struck when Hydra massacred hundreds of new S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but Hydra inadvertently provided replacements when Fury discovered the comatose agents believed slain by the Deltites. Learning of Strucker's survival, Fury again confronted his nemesis and defeated him, although Strucker eluded capture. Reunited with his longtime agents and friends, Fury set about expanding S.H.I.E.L.D., which eventually neared the size and complexity of its predecessor. Fury even made peace with his son Mikel, whom he recruited as an agent to help him when internal strife in Hydra fueled subversive activity in his home neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen. |||| |||| Sometime later, Fury received a coded distress message from someone called Fallen Angel, who claimed to be Rick Stoner, long believed dead. Commissioning a specialized LMD (Life Model Decoy) android duplicate from Tony Stark, Fury left the duplicate in his place and traced the signal to Project: Backslide, an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. experiment, only to be pulled into a pocket dimension with Fallen Angel, who, regardless of his true identity, died shortly afterward, leaving Fury stranded for months. Unknown to Fury, his LMD duplicate captured and tried to rehabilitate the killer vigilante Punisher; however, the Spook, Fury's longtime rival, brainwashed the Punisher into assassinating the LMD, believed by all to be Fury. Meanwhile, Fury's subconscious had remade the pocket dimension into a duplicate of wartime Europe, where he relived past Howlers missions. He regained his senses through the arrival of Sharon Carter, an agent of the prior S.H.I.E.L.D., long thought dead; although Carter had come seeking vengeance on Fury, she ultimately helped him return to Earth. Fury briefly stepped down from S.H.I.E.L.D. directorship, leaving Carter to succeed him, but he soon returned, driving himself harder than ever. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most serious setbacks came when the Helicarrier was hijacked by the Red Skull, who joined forces with the Hate-Monger in an effort to spread hatred across the world, but the villains were defeated by Fury, Captain America, and their fellow wartime veteran, Namor the Sub-Mariner. |||| |||| Ultimately, despite Fury's best efforts, the second incarnation of S.H.I.E.L.D. has proven no more immune to corruption than the first, and Fury has grown dubious of some of the agency's more inhumane operations, such as the so-called Deathlok project. Fury even briefly lost command of S.H.I.E.L.D., being demoted to a desk job. Despite ending the threat of former Hydra agent Rudy Gargarin on Napoleon Island, Fury had to struggle to regain his position. Moreover, as superhuman incidents become more widespread and devastating, Fury, despite his efforts to steer government attention away from such allies as Spider-Man and Daredevil, has found himself at odds with the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and even his old friends Captain America and Wolverine, whom he has been reduced to manipulating on more than one mission, including a recent foray into Latveria that left hard feelings all around and resulted in Fury losing directorship of S.H.I.E.L.D. and going into hiding. Fury is now working underground. It remains to be seen how long Fury can tread the line between conflicting loyalties."

1709,Porcupine (Marvel)(01 - Alex Gentry),Alexander Gentry ,1709_20061110061049_char.jpg,,,"The character was originally created as a weapons designer for the United States Army, conceived the idea of designing a battlesuit in imitation of a porcupine: it would be covered with quill-like projections for defense. Moreover, it would be able to shoot its quills, or gases, chemicals, or weapons from quill-like tubes, at an opponent. (In actuality, a porcupine cannot shoot its quills, although they can be detached from its body) Gentry spent months working on overtime to create his porcupine battlesuit. He was enormously proud of his achievement when the suit was finished, and believed his invention was worth a fortune. Yet Gentry also believed that the government would pay him, one of its employees, virtually nothing for his creation. Angrily, Gentry decided to keep the porcupine battlesuit and to use it to make himself wealthy through crime. Thus Gentry became the Porcupine, one of the first costumed criminals of his generation. |||| |||| Hank Pym, who was then the original Ant-Man, and his partner, Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, soon defeated the Porcupine. However, the Porcupine succeeded in escaping, and unsuccessfully tried to take revenge on them after Pym had also assumed the superhuman powers and identity of Giant-Man. During a battle with Giant-Man, the Porcupine stole and consumed a large number of what he thought were the capsules that Giant-Man used to grow in size. In fact, though, they were the capsules Giant-Man used to shrink himself, and the Porcupine shrank out of sight. |||| |||| Eventually, however, the capsules' effect wore off, and the Porcupine, again at his normal size, was among the many costumed menaces assembled by Doctor Doom to disrupt the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm. |||| |||| His self-confidence still shaken by his failures in battling Giant-Man and the Wasp, the Porcupine eagerly accepted the invitation of Count Nefaria, a powerful figure in the criminal Maggia, to join his group of costumed agents. Among Nefaria's agents were the original Eel, the Plantman, and the Scarecrow, with all of whom the Porcupine would ally himself in the future as well. The Porcupine and the other costumed agents aided Count Nefaria in his attempt to hold much of Washington D.C. for ransom. However, the original X-Men thwarted Nefaria and his agents. Once again, the Porcupine succeeded in escaping being taken prisoner, and he blamed the failure of the blackmail scheme on Nefaria and the other agents. But Gentry suspected that in fact, he himself was inadequate for the role of being a 'super-villain' battling superhuman opponents. |||| |||| It is not known what the Porcupine did between the end of this venture and his enlistment as a member of Batroc's Brigade. As a Brigade member, the Porcupine unsuccessfully battled Captain America. Months later, the Porcupine and his allies the original Eel, the Plantman, and the Scarecrow, went to work for the masked criminal mastermind who called himself the Cowled Commander. Once again, the Porcupine clashed with Captain America but was defeated. |||| |||| Convinced that they were failures, Gentry and Leopold Stryke, who was the original Eel, sought guidance from the Celestial Mind Control movement, which was secretly masterminded by the alien Nebulon. Nebulon pitted the Porcupine and the Eel against his foes, the costumed adventurers called the Defenders, who defeated them both. |||| |||| Later, the Porcupine and a small group of confederates invaded a major Manhattan hotel to steal the valuables in its safe. This time the Porcupine erred by deciding to rob the wealthy attendees at a fashion show in one of the hotel's ballrooms. Unfortunately for him, the show as being given by fashion designer Janet van Dyne, who was also the Wasp. Moreover, Henry Pym, who now used the costumed identity of Yellowjacket, was also present, as was Kyle Richmond, the adventurer called Nighthawk. The Wasp, Yellowjacket, and Nighthawk quickly defeated the criminals, and the Porcupine felt humiliated at being overpowered by the Wasp and Yellowjacket when they were both at the size of insects. |||| |||| Perhaps believing there was safety in numbers, the Porcupine next turned up as one of a large assemblage of costumed criminals organized by the original versions of Libra and Sagittarius of the android Zodiac. This time the Porcupine was defeated by the Hellcat during a battle between a number of the criminals and a group of adventurers operating under the auspices of the Defenders. |||| |||| The Porcupine went to prison but was soon released by minions of billionaire Justin Hammer. The Porcupine agreed to provide Hammer with half the proceeds from his criminal activities in exchange for Hammer's financial support. The Porcupine was among the small army of costumed criminals whom Hammer sent to attack Iron Man when the latter turned up on Hammer's enormous 'houseboat' headquarters. Iron Man succeeded in defeating all of these criminals. Presumably the Porcupine's failure in this instance was one of the reasons that Hammer fired the Porcupine from his employ. |||| |||| Tired of his long string of defeats, Gentry believed his criminal career had become a joke. He decided to give up his career as a costumed criminal and live off the millions of dollars he expected to receive by selling his battlesuit. Gentry totally redesigned his porcupine battlesuit, making it far deadlier than before. He entered into negotiations with the subversive organization called the Secret Empire to sell them the suit. The Empire requested proof of the battlesuit's capabilities, so Gentry said he would prove it was the perfect combat suit by testing it in battle against Captain America, the ultimate soldier. But Captain America and his ally Nomad defeated the Porcupine, and Gentry was returned to jail. |||| |||| In prison, Gentry vowed never to be defeated again, and to ensure that, he decided never to put on the Porcupine battlesuit again. Gentry was soon released from prison, apparently legally, under unknown circumstances, and he set about once more to try to sell the battlesuit. But by now Porcupine was seemingly universally regarded by major criminals and leading subversive organizations as a laughable failure, and hence they saw his battlesuit as virtually worthless to them. Gentry tried to sell it to the Secret Empire, AIM, HYDRA, the Kingpin, the Maggia, the Tinkerer, various others, and finally to the Serpent Society, but almost no one wanted it, and the few offers he did receive for it were insultingly low. |||| |||| Gentry was in despair, but finally came up with the idea of selling the battlesuit to the Avengers to prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. Captain America was intrigued by Gentry's proposal, and in talking to Gentry, learned that he knew how to contact the Serpent Society, whom Captain America had been trying to bring to justice. Captain America agreed to have the Avengers buy the battlesuit if Gentry helped get him to members of the Serpent Society. Gentry accepted Captain America's terms. |||| |||| Captain America's plan was for Gentry to pretend to have captured him and to offer the Serpent Society the opportunity to kill him. Gentry contacted the Society's leader, Sidewinder, and arranged to have some of the Society Members meet him at a lower Manhattan construction site. Gentry, having reluctantly donned his Porcupine costume once more as part of the plan, pretended to guard Captain America, who was seemingly bound with chains. Gentry was frightened and did not want to have to do any fighting, but Captain America told him he could leave as soon as he had turned the Captain over to the Society members. |||| |||| Four Society members soon appeared: Cottonmouth, Death Adder, Diamondback, and the Rattler. Captain America took the Society members by surprise, and the Porcupine began to flee. Diamondback, realizing that the Porcupine had set them up, went after him and threw two nitroglycerin-filled diamond weapons at him. The weapons exploded on impact, damaging his battlesuit somewhat, but not harming him. Nevertheless, seeing his only valuable asset, the costume, damaged, Gentry flew into a rage and attacked Diamondback. She again damaged his suit somehow, and as he tried to escape her, he tripped and fell. |||| |||| Due to the damage to his suit Gentry was impaled on one of his own quills when he fell. Apparently, the quill went into his heart, for the injury proved fatal. Diamondback escaped, but Captain America defeated the other three Society members. Captain America found Gentry dying and in despair. Gentry said that 'I'm going to die as I lived…one big loser.' Captain America tried to reassure Gentry, told him he had helped him defeat three Serpent Society members, and that therefore Gentry was a hero. But Gentry refused to believe the Captain's kind words, saying that he, Gentry, was 'nothing' and had led a worthless life. Captain America replied that Gentry had proved to be a worthy opponent, but it is not known whether this compliment mattered to Gentry, for he expired seconds later without having said another word. |||| |||| In tribute to Gentry, Captain America had him buried in a grave reserved by the Avengers for those who have fallen in battle, and put his battlesuit on exhibit in Avengers Mansion, labeled 'Battle Armor of the Porcupine — Honored Foe of the Avengers'."

Their means of conquest is most unusual. They send out ships across the galaxy, searching out planets in the early stages of development. Once the ship lands in the most inhospitable location available on the planet, it sends out a hypnotic signal which summons one of each life form on the planet. The life form that arrives first at the ship is quickly disected and its genetic code implanted on millions of egg-pairs. The egg-pairs are then ejected across the world where they will find their mate and begin their conquest of the planet. When a Plodex ship approached earth, something went wrong, and it crash landed. The egg-pairs were ejected without genetic imprinting. |||| |||| |||| One of the eggs managed to survive for tens of thousands of years beneath the atlantic ocean. The egg was found by Tom Smallwood when he was washed overboard of his fishing boat. He returned to the his Newfoundland home, and gave the egg to his wife Gladys. When Gladys broke the shell she imprinted Marrina with human female DNA. Marrina grew up mostly normal, except for her odd appearance. She joined Department H when she was approximately 16 and was the first member of Gamma Flight. She quickly rose to Beta Flight and, by the time that Department H's funding was cut she was ready to become a member of Alpha Flight.When Alpha Flight became independent, she joined the team as an active member. |||| |||| The, malevolent self proclaimed, Master Of The World had discovered the lost Plodex ship, and there had learned of it's nature. He also learned of the hatching of one of the egg pairs, one of whom was Marrina. The Master used the Plodex ship to summon, and capture Marrina. In doing so she went wild, and nearly killed her friend, and teammate, Puck. She was rescued not long after by Alpha Flight, with assistance from Namor, and The Invisible Woman. Once free Marrina decided to take some time to see the world, and left with Namor to visit Atlantis. Inevitably the two fell in love. The Master had come to control Marrina's intended mate, the other surviving Plodex Egg. This mate however had evolved into a monstrous sea monster, that The Master set loose killing people. Puck called upon Marrina and Namor to investigate the killings. While Marrina was in close proximity to the beast, it triggered her bestial side. She attacked Puck and Namor before the three of them were captured by The Master. They managed to escape, and destroy The Master's submarine, and in the process Marrina slipped away in shame. Being normally very sweet natured, her dark side was difficult for her to face, and she did not want her beloved Namor to see see it. |||| |||| |||| It was at this time that she was captured by the Atlantean warlord, Attuma. He used her now monstrous appearance to turn the people of Atlantis against Namor. A great battle ensued |||| with Alpha Flight and the Avengers, against the forces of Attuma. Marrina fled the battle, and began to grow odd pustules on her skin. It seemed that during her exposer to her Plodex mate in the Master's submarine, the two had mated, and she was now pregnant. The pustules on her flesh we in fact egg pods, almost ready to hatch. When Namor and Alpha flight caught up with Marrina, they discovered her Plodex Mate had also arrived, to protect her through the hatching of the eggs. In a moment of defiance, Marrina rejected her alien heritage, inspired by her love for her friends and family, and for Namor. She managed to completely reject the eggs growing in her skin, destroying them. The heroes slew her monstrous Plodex Mate, and she and Namor were wed. |||| |||| |||| Marrina and Namor took the Atlanteans who remained loyal to Namor, and founded a new aquatic nation called Deluvia. Eventually that nation fell, and Namor joined the forces of the Avengers, with Marrina becoming a close associate of the team. Through her relationship with Namor, Marrina became pregnant, and transformed into a giant sea creature called Leviathan. Namor was forced to slay his beloved with the the Black Knight's Ebony Blade. Before she died however, she Marrina had managed to lay at least 3 eggs, which the Avengers discovered had hatched. |||| |||| When Llan the Sorcerer revived The Master Of The World from a comatose state, he informed him that Marrina 'Sleeps a false death under the waves'. |||| |||| Years later, Marrina was found alive by Norman Osborn in her transformed state.

She was one of the principle heroes targeted by the Congressional investigation into comic book morality--for lack of the official name. Though most modern observers would find the early 50s criticisms of her patently absurd, the charges stuck, and the superhero genre nearly died amidst talk of Wonder Woman's unhealthy obsession with bondage, lesbianism and inappropriate independence from men. |||| |||| As events have transpired in the DCU since the 1950s, most all of her wartime appearances have been officially retconned, and her initial membership in the Justice Society has now been retroactively ascribed to her mother, Hippolyta. Thus, even though we might see Diana appearing for the first time in All-Star Comics #8, DC would like us to believe, now, that all of her appearances in the original JSA run in fact happened to her mother, Hippolyta. Consequently her 'first appearance' is now quite confusing, because Diana is shown to be the one clearly appearing 'as Wonder Woman', and Hippolyta is clearly shown to be there simply as Queen and mother of Diana. Oddly enough, the first appearance of Wonder Woman must now be retconned completely out of existence in the post-CRISIS world. For these reasons, this character included so you don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure out things 'from a post-Crisis perspective'. If the story happened since the February 1987 Pérez reboot following Crisis on Infinite Earths , use this character."

He has proven strong enough to break a needle composed of the Ultimate Marvel Universe's version of Adamantium. In times of stress the Hulk's adrenaline level escalates, causing a corresponding escalation in strength. This is not accompanied by an additional gain in mass, but does appear to promote increased levels of energy efficiency. To date the Hulk has never apparently been provoked into demonstrating a maximum output of strength, hence his upper limit remains a mystery. However, whatever the limit, it is well in excess of 100 tons. The Hulk's great strength also exends into the highly developed muscles of his legs and allow shim to leap great distances. Currently the single longest recorded jump is upwards of 3 miles. |||| |||| Superhuman Stamina: The Hulk's body counteracts fatique poisons; while fighting others in an enraged state, he can maintain peak output for hours on end and still continue to become even stronger as his anger escalates. He has swum the Atlantic Ocean from the Eastern Seaboard of the USA to France without rest. |||| |||| Superhuman Durability: In addition to great strength, the Hulk's body possesses a high degree of resistance to injury, pain, and disease. The Hulk's skin is capable of withstanding great heat without blistering, great cold without freezing, and tremendous levels of physical trauma. The Hulk's resistance to harm has extended to the point where he can withstand a zero point detonation of a nuclear weapon. He has also been able to resist Jovian atmospheric pressures. |||| |||| Regenerative Healing Factor: The Hulk is capable of regenerating damaged or destroyed areas of his body with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. Wounds that would be deadly to most other creatures take a short period time for the Hulk to recover. The Hulk's highly efficient physiology renders him immune to all known Earthly diseases. |||| |||| Superhuman speed: Hulk has been seen running at speeds greater than 200mph |||| |||| |||| Abilities |||| Bruce Banner is a brilliant scientist with extensive knowledge of human anatomy. He is also a highly rated expert in radiation and its effects on the human body. The Hulk, while having no formal training, is a formidable hand to hand combatant simply due to his great physical attributes. He typically uses street fighting and brawling techniques that make full use of his strength. |||| |||| |||| Strength level |||| Ultimate Hulk has been seen to overpower Ultimate Thor in physical combat, engage and overpower the Abomination during the invasion of the Liberators as well as engaging and nearly overwhelming a combined force of two versions of Squadron Supreme, the Ultimate X-Men, the Ultimate Fantastic Four and the Ultimates before being narrowly defeated. He has been rated as having a strength level in excess of 100 tons, in the same tier as Thanos and the Silver Searcher.",,"As a result in a failed attempt of re-creating the Super Soldier Serum that made the famed Captain America, Bruce Banner mutated and became the green Hulk, fighting Spider-man and destroying Chelsea piers. After this incident Bruce Banner became somewhat a pariah. |||| |||| In The Ultimates, Banner had to take a long leave after the incident before being re-instated. He had to get three blood tests a day and they were unable to find traces of Hulk cells for 12 weeks. Banner frequently took pills to prevent himself from sleeping because he said 'Being asleep felt too much like the Hulk being awake'. |||| |||| He got demoted to second-in-charge after the Pyms. When the body of Captain America is found in the Arctic Ocean, Banner's job changes from recreating the Super Soldier Serum to extracting the Super Soldier Serum from Captain America. |||| |||| After seeing the Pyms make more advances, he began to look at himself as a failure, because he had failed to complete his task and because of his broken relationship with Betty. |||| |||| Since the Ultimates didn't seem to have any action, Bruce decided to make some. He carefully devised a plan where the Ultimates would appear to be heroes. He set up an antidote with an adamantium needle. He mixed the Super Soldier Serum with the Hulk serum and injected himself with it. He became the Grey Hulk. He climbed a building King Kong style, wanting to kill Freddie Prinze Junior out of jealousy. |||| |||| This Hulk was much stronger than the original. He took on all the Ultimates and even broke an adamantium needle. This Hulk was more like Banner's inner emotions let out, being over protective of Betty, and talking about how Betty made him horny. He was finally reverted to Banner by Wasp when she stung part of his brain, rendering him unconscious. |||| |||| He was held in a special cell and had to take medication frequently. He said he could control his rage by watching 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. He escaped during the 'Ultimate War' and ate 3 doctors. He was restrained and again held captive. |||| |||| When the Chitauri came to invade Earth, they decided they needed the Hulk's help. They threw Banner off a helicopter to traumatize him and turn him into the Hulk and told him that Kleiser was with Betty. The Hulk ended up eating Herr Kleiser and was reverted to Banner via Antidote Arrow by Hawkeye. |||| |||| News of the connection between Hulk and Banner spread through the media via Black Widow. S.H.I.E.L.D., embarrassed, held a trial for the Hulk and gave him a death sentence for killing over 800 people. They sedated Banner with sedative made by Pym and put him on an ship where they would nuke it and destroy the Hulk forever. Banner transformed into the Hulk before he landed on the Island. It is speculated that the sedative was specially formulated so Banner would survive. |||| |||| Banner then made a secret phone call to Pym. |||| |||| Banner then managed to swim to a Parisian Beach. Banner turns into the Hulk after he gets infuriated by a Parisian psychologist. Then he relocates himself to a farm but again gets infuriated when he is mocked about eating tofurkey, a tofu turkey substitute.

9,Cyclops (Marvel)(03 - Scott Summers),Scott Summers ,9_20050924203346_char.jpg,"Cyclops possesses the mutant ability to project a beam of heat-less ruby-colored concussive force from his eyes, which act as inter-dimensional apertures between this universe and another. Cyclops' body constantly absorbs ambient energy, such as sunlight, from his environment into his body's cells that allows him to open the apertures. Cyclops' mind generates a psionic field that is attuned to the forces that maintain the apertures. Because this field envelops his body, it automatically shunts the other-dimensional particles back into their point of origin when they collide with his body. Thus, his body is protected from the effects of the particles, and even the thin membranes of his eyelids are sufficient to block the emission of energy. The synthetic ruby quartz crystal used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops' eye-wear is resonant to his minds' psionic field and is similarly protected. |||| |||| The width of Cyclops' optic blast is focused by his mind's psionic field with the same autonomic function that regulated his original eyes' ability to focus. As Cyclops focuses, the size of the apertures change and thus act as a valve to control the flow of particles and the beam's relative power. The height of Cyclops's eye-blast is controlled by his visor's adjustable slit. The beam's effective range is approximately 2,000 feet. |||| |||| Due to a head injury, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts at will and must therefore wear ruby quartz lenses to block the beams.",,"Scott Summers was the first of two sons born to Major Christopher Summers, a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, and his wife Katherine. Christopher was flying his family home from vacation when their plane was attacked by a spacecraft from the interstellar Shi'ar Empire. To save their lives, Katherine pushed Scott and his brother Alex out of the plane with the only available parachute. Scott suffered a head injury upon landing, thus forever preventing him from controlling his mutant power by himself. |||| |||| With their parents presumed dead, the authorities separated the two boys. Alex was adopted, but Scott remained comatose in a hospital for a year. On recovering, he was placed in an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska that was secretly controlled by his future enemy, the evil geneticist Mister Sinister. |||| |||| As a teenager, Scott came into the foster care of Jack Winters, a mutant criminal known as the Jack O'Diamonds. After Scott began to suffer from severe headaches he was sent to a specialist who discovered that lenses made of ruby quartz corrected the problem. Soon after, Scott's mutant power first erupted from his eyes as an uncontrollable blast of optic force. The blast demolished a crane, causing it to drop its payload toward a terrified crowd. Scott saved lives by obliterating the object with another blast, but the bystanders believed that he had tried to kill them and rallied into an angry mob. Scott fled, escaping on a freight train. |||| |||| Winters sought to use Scott's new-found talent in his crimes, and physically abused the young boy when he initially refused. However, Scott's display of power had attracted the attention of the mutant telepath Professor Charles Xavier, who teamed up with F.B.I. agent Fred Duncan in their mutual attempt to find Scott. Scott was rescued from Winters' clutches and was enlisted by Xavier as the first member of the X-Men, a team of young mutants who trained to use their powers in the fight for human/mutant equality. |||| |||| As Cyclops, Scott became deputy leader of the X-Men. While he was a skilled tactician, his social skills were lacking. Scott had fallen in love with his teammate Jean Grey, but his reserved demeanor prevented him from expressing his feelings for her for years. When Xavier's other original recruits left the fold following an encounter with the sentient island-being Krakoa, Cyclops stayed on as deputy leader of the new team. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force took Jean's place. When it committed suicide, Scott believed the love of his life had died and he left the X-Men. During his time away from the team, Scott met fishing boat captain Lee Forrester who helped him work through his grief. Scott eventually returned to the X-Men whereupon he met Madelyne Pryor, a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Jean. Unaware that Madelyne was a clone of Jean created by Sinister, Scott fell in love with Madelyne and they were soon married. Madelyne fell pregnant and bore Scott a son named Nathan Christopher. |||| |||| When the real Jean emerged from suspended animation, Scott abandoned his wife and son and rejoined the other original X-Men in establishing a new team, X-Factor. During a demonic invasion of New York City, X-Factor and the X-Men fought against a super-powered and insane Madelyne. The invasion was thwarted after Madelyne perished in combat with Jean. |||| |||| Later, the mutant warlord named Apocalypse infected baby Nathan with a techno-organic virus. To save his son's life, Scott had to allow a member of the Clan Askani to transport Nathan two millennia into the future, where it had been foreseen that he would deliver the world from Apocalypse’s clutches. X-Factor disbanded soon after, and its members returned to the ranks of the X-Men. Scott and his long-time love Jean were married, and whilst on their honeymoon their spirits were taken into the time-stream by the Clan Askani’s matriarch. Arriving in the future, they inhabited new bodies and raised Nathan for twelve years. When they returned to their own time and bodies, Nathan remained in the future and ultimately matured into his time's greatest hero: Cable. |||| |||| Following Professor X's arrest for crimes committed as the evil psionic entity Onslaught, Scott assumed the role of leadership of the X-Men once more. Soon after, the government sponsored mutant-hunting operation known as 'Zero Tolerance' took effect, and the villainous Bastion captured the X-Men. In his attempt to destroy mutant-kind, Bastion placed a nanotech bomb inside Scott’s body. The X-Men escaped, and the mutant doctor named Cecilia Reyes saved Scott’s life. Scott and his wife soon took a leave of absence from the X-Men for a period of recuperation. |||| |||| Not long after returning to the team, Scott and Jean soon found themselves embroiled in Apocalypse's bid for cosmic power by assembling 'The Twelve' - a group of mutants who would determine the fate of their kind that included Scott, Jean, and Cable. They were wired to a machine that would channel their awesome energies into Apocalypse, allowing him to absorb the body of the time-tossed powerful mutant teenager known as X-Man. As his teammates fell around him, a powerless Scott saved X-Man and merged with the would-be conqueror to create a new evil entity. Jean detected Scott's psyche inside Apocalypse and prevented the X-Men from destroying him, however he was presumed dead by most of his teammates. Only Jean and Cable refused to believe Scott had perished. |||| |||| Investigating rumors he was alive, the pair found him in the birthplace of Apocalypse in Akkaba, Egypt, struggling to reassert his mind over the villain's psyche. Ultimately, Jean was able to physically rip Apocalypse's essence from Scott's body using her mental powers, and Cable destroyed it with his own powers. |||| |||| Scott left for a small period of recuperation, during which he met and reconciled with his father. Afterwards, Scott returned to the X-Men, but his association with Apocalypse had given him a grimmer, more serious personality than ever before. As a result, many of his relationships became strained, including his marriage to Jean. Scott sought the counsel of his teammate Emma Frost and the pair began a psychic affair. When Jean discovered Scott's betrayal, he left the X-Men in order to sort out the mess his life had become. |||| |||| Following the outing of Professor X as a mutant to the world, his school was rechristened the Xavier Institute of Higher Learning and opened its doors to the mutant population at large, training and educating dozens of young new students to help them cope with their burgeoning abilities. After the death of his wife, Scott assumed the position of co-headmaster of the School alongside his new love, Emma. |||| |||| Cyclops's world was further upset when a mysterious mutant attacked and brought him and Marvel Girl to a secret abandoned facility. Cyclops eventually discovered that the mutant was none other than his brother Gabriel, who had been a student of Moira's that Professor X had sent to rescue Scott from Krakoa. Scott had witnessed the apparent deaths of Gabriel and his teammates; Xavier had mind-wiped him to alleviate the psychic trauma of the event. Shaken to the core, Cyclops expelled the then powerless Xavier from the Institute. |||| |||| Recently, a teenage version of Cyclops (along with the rest of the original X-Men) was brought from the past and is stranded in the present. This Cyclops has since been a member of the Starjammers and the Champions."

This Hyperion was an alien from a subatomic parallel universe, pulled from his world by the Grandmaster for his own purposes, though later comics suggested that the Grandmaster simply created this Hyperion. |||| |||| After his initial clash with the Avengers, he had repeated clashes with the Defenders. Eventually he later fell in love with the heroine Thundra, although this was a brief love affair. Finally, he met the original Hyperion through the machinations of Emil Burbank (a.k.a.Master Menace) on Earth-Squadron. On this occasion Burbank battled Hyperion while holding captive the visiting Thor. Suffering defeat once more, Hyperion was taken captive on Earth-S but later found himself in an interdimensional vacuum as he attempted to escape confinement. |||| |||| During the Squadron's dominance on the world scene, Master Menace pulled Hyperion back through the interdimensional gulf and revealed his true origins. He was actually an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster based on Hyperion I's physique. As such, he was revealed to be Marvel's version of Bizarro, although retaining sufficient, though uninspired, intellect. Master Menace caused the two Hyperions to swap places for several weeks, with the good version in the interdimensional void. The evil Hyperion proceeded to quickly fall in love with Zarda, (a.k.a. Power Princess), who reminded him of Thundra. The evil Hyperion secretly murdered Zarda's husband, the death appearing to result from natural causes. Forming a romance with the distraught heroine, this caused her confusion as the heroic version returned to Earth-S to battle his counterpart. During an epic struggle, with both emitting full intensity of their atomic vision, the evil version began to degrade rapidly, revealing his true nature. After Hyperion II's death, however, his counterpart Hyperion I resumed the romance with Zarda. |||| |||| Although this 'evil' version of Hyperion preceded the 'good' version in his appearance, he is considered Hyperion (II), while the former is considered Hyperion (I)."

Pieter was a gifted kid who quickly became interested in medicine. At an early age he went to the United States where he graduated from Harvard Medical School at age 19. He then became a gifted surgeon, who developed advanced techniques in limb grafting. At some point he became involved in a well-publicized battle over insurance fraud that led to Cross' loss of residency. Although lawsuits were threatened they were never filed. Following the scandal Cross went underground and began operating outside the realm of the established medical community. He set up a free clinic in Portsmouth City to treat those who didn't have the money to get treatment elsewhere. Every night he went to the slums of the North East Side of the city where he helped out in any way he could, such as supplying the prostitutes with condoms, and delivering fresh spikes and gallons of bleach to the Mercy Mission for its needle exchange program. His nightly prowls soon earned him the nickname 'the Midnight Doctor'. Although he had no direct ties to the F.D.A. he has often unofficially helped out the government in various cases, and he also unofficially helps out at some of the larger hospitals in the city. |||| |||| Recently Cross got involved in a case regarding the drug A39, an accidental derivative of the Venom serum which got stolen from a government lab. When the drug suddenly turned up all over the streets Cross helped out the F.D.A. to get hold of a sample. However the heads of Preada Industries who were behind the mass-production of A39 learned of Cross' meddling in their business and became determined to get rid of him. Using one of their agents they managed to give Cross the drug which kicked in while Cross was driving home and as a result he lost control of the car and crashed. When he woke up he realized that he had lost his eyesight as a result of the blast from the crash, but he also found that the drug had interacted with some other chemicals in his bloodstream enabling his eyes to see the infrared spectrum. Cross then fashioned some special lenses that focused the other spectrums into his narrowed range. Determined to use his newfound abilities to the common good, he designed a costume for himself and adopted the identity of 'Doctor Mid-Nite' out of respect for the Golden Age hero and began operating under the cover of darkness to protect Portsmouth City against sinister agencies such as Praeda Industries. |||| |||| Doctor Mid-Nite is surrounded by a number of assistants, consisting of a number of persons whose eternal friendship Cross has earned by helping them out in their time of need. One of these is Camilla Marlowe, a young woman Cross came into contact with during the whole A39 affair, who has become a close confidant of the doctor and has set up the 'Dr. Mid-Nite Web Site', a site that free advice for the cyber-patients among other things. Other noteworthy assistants include Nite-Lite and Ice Sickle. |||| |||| Doctor Mid-Nite recently helped out the Justice Society of America on a case. Impressed with his work he was invited to join and he accepted."

Howard met Maria while the two were working on an experimental biological agent that could work as body armor. The two fell in love and married. While Maria was pregnant she was bitten by a lab monkey (probably the rhesus species) and fatally infected with a regenerative virus. The virus mutated her unborn child, Tony, growing additional 'undifferentiated' neural tissue throughout his body, as if his whole body itself is a brain, which augmented his intelligence while causing chronic pain due to the over-stimulation of the neural cells that make up his skin.

His capacity for physical strength is potentially limitless due to the fact that the Hulk's strength increases proportionally with his level of great emotional stress, anger in particular. The Hulk uses his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances. The Hulk has been known to cover hundreds of miles in a single bound and once leaped almost into orbit around the Earth. The Hulk has shown a high resistance to physical damage nearly regardless of the cause, and has also shown resistance to extreme temperatures, poisons, and diseases in addition to regeneration of damaged or destroyed areas of tissue at an amazing rate. |||| |||| The Hulk's body also has a gland that makes an 'oxygenated per fluorocarbon emulsion', which creates pressure in the Hulk's lungs and effectively lets him breathe underwater and move quickly between varying depths without concerns about decompression or nitrogen narcosis.",,"Supervising the trial of an experimental gamma bomb for the U.S. Defense Department at a nuclear research facility in New Mexico, Dr. Robert Bruce Banner selflessly rushed to the rescue of an ignorant teenager who had wandered onto the testing field as the countdown ticked inexorably toward zero. After shoving young Rick Jones to safety in a nearby ditch, Banner was struck full-force by the bomb blast. He survived, but was irradiated by the deadly gamma energy. |||| |||| At first, Banner would transform into the brutish gray Hulk only at sunset, and revert to human form at dawn. Eventually, his changes into the childlike green Hulk came to be triggered by the release of adrenaline when he was intensely excited, no matter what time of day. The green Hulk possesses little of Banner's memory and intelligence, and is easily enraged; making him a menace to society. |||| |||| Since Banner's initial transformation into the Hulk, military forces commanded by the implacable General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross; father of his late wife, Betty -- have hunted him continually. |||| |||| For a short time, Banner successfully treated his condition with radiation and was able to maintain enough of his own personality when he became the Hulk to control himself in that form. Subsequently, he helped found the Avengers and even received a presidential pardon. Ultimately, however, the Hulk reverted into a brutish menace. |||| |||| Gamma-powered psychiatrist Leonard 'Doc' Samson captured the Hulk and successfully separated Banner and his alter ego. Without Banner's psyche to restrain him, the Hulk became a greater danger than ever before. Realizing there was only one way to reign in the Hulk, Banner agreed to merge with the monster. But the stress of the re-integration fractured Banner's subconscious, creating the street-smart gray Hulk. During this time, he spent several years in Las Vegas, sometimes operating as an enforcer calling himself Mr. Fixit (or 'Joe Fixit.') The smart-mouth Fixit was an ill-tempered, wise-cracking, thuggish brute whose personality resembled that of his father and the fraternity boys who surrounded him in college. It was also at this time that Joe Fixit began his a short-lived relationship with the future wife of Rick Jones, Marlo Chandler. In this state of the Hulk, Banner again found himself changing into the Hulk at night and into his human form in the light of the day. |||| |||| Soon after, the swirling mess of persona and mentalities took their toll on the ever-flustered mind of Dr. Banner, and a battle for supremacy and control took place in Banner's subconscious. With assistance by the Ringmaster and his hypnotic abilities, Doc Samson tapped into the subconscious of Banner and reached his separate incarnations. Through this hypnosis, Banner, the green Hulk, and the grey Fixit all aligned to face their true inner demons-- Banner's unresolved issues with his abusive father and the murderer of his mother. With this realization, Banner was able to fuse these mentalities together, finding peace of mind. However, a green but intelligent version of the Hulk emerged. He had the mentality of Dr. Banner but the body and abilities of the Hulk. |||| |||| Unfortunately Dr. Banner soon realized that he must once again keep his temper in check, as if he let his rage loose, the mentality of the savage green Hulk would soon take over, albeit in the form of Banner's human body. Without the strength of the Hulk and filled with the Green Goliath's rage and belief of his old abilities, he proved to be a great danger to himself. This was, however, not to last. During the assault of the being known as Onslaught, the Hulk asked Jean Grey to let the green Hulk loose from its mental prison in order to use his maximum potential and abilities to defeat the menace. In a strange twist, Banner became divided. The Banner physically went away to a parallel world created upon Onslaught's defeat, where he once again became the savage green Hulk. Remaining on Earth, was a cold, somewhat unfeeling but intelligible version of the jade monster. This version of the Hulk also found himself allied with Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur), who made Hulk into one of his Four Horsemen. |||| |||| This surly version of the Hulk remained in this state, never changing until much later when the consciousness of Banner was awakened from a personal hell where he was trapped in his own subconscious and haunted by his memories of his father, his future self (the Maestro), the Leader, and his past Banner and Hulk incarnations. Banner's freedom and escape from this subconscious hell was only achieved through self-realization and the understanding that his true strength came from within, proving his redemption from his fears. Upon this realization, Banner was guided to consciousness though the visage of his true love, Betty. |||| |||| Though never a team player, the Hulk joined forces with the Dr. Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, and Namor, the Atlantean Sub-Mariner, to defeat the techno-wizard Yandroth and his ultimate computer, the Omegatron. Thereafter, this loose-knit band of Defenders would unite periodically to oppose threats to humanity. The original Defenders reluctantly re-formed when Yandroth surfaced again to menace the world. Though the heroes defeated his plan, Yandroth used his sorcery to levy a deathbed curse upon their heads, binding them to come together in times of crisis. |||| |||| After the events of the M-Day, Banner sought refuge and peace in Alaska, where he lived as a hermit loosely connected to the town community. He was eventually tracked down by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who required his help in defeating the Hydra space weapon called the Godseye which could detonate all the nuclear bombs in the world. Sent up as the Hulk, he discovered that the Godseye was actually a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. weapon that could match the strength of any enemy. In the ensuing battle, the Godseye found that though it could try, it could not match the increasing power of the Hulk, and it exploded. |||| A S.H.I.E.L.D. commissioned space shuttle was sent to retrieve the Hulk, or so he believed. Seizing the opportunity to be rid of the Hulk, a group of superheroes known as the Illuminati decided to jettison the shuttle into space, to a planet with no intelligent life forms. Unfortunately, there was a navigation error, and the Hulk landed on Planet Sakaar, a planet full of barbarian tribes, gladiator battles and ruled over by a corrupt empire. The planet was situated near a portal, which gave it access to several different cultures and technologies. Weakened by his travel, Hulk was taken captive and sold into slavery and sent to the Great Arena to die in the games. After overcoming the first challenge set before him, Hulk was given the opportunity to be pardoned by the Red King, but instead he chose to attack him and was knocked out by the Red King when he became distracted. The Hulk soon joined several others in a group that would have to learn to fight together and, in result, they became warbound. The Hulk and his team of misfit warriors overcame the challenges set before them and became known as great warriors throughout the planet, inspiring many to rebel against the Red King. |||| |||| Soon thereafter, Hulk and his team were forced to fight a captured Silver Surfer who struck them fiercely. Hulk, angered by Silver Surfer's betrayal, attacked the Surfer and inadvertently released him from the disc implant embedded within him. Freed of the implant disc that kept him prisoner, the Surfer destroyed the rest of the implant discs embedded in the rest of the warriors. The Hulk declined the Silver Surfer's offer of transportation back to his world so as to finish things on Planet Sakaar. Hulk then stood with his freed Warbound companions against the tyrannous Red King. |||| |||| After several hard fought battles, the evolution of Miek, and finally gaining the confidence of Caiera the Oldstrong, Hulk and the Warbound confronted the Red King. With those few still loyal to him, the King in his Death's Head Armor did battle with Hulk. As he soon saw he was no match for the Green Scar, the Red King activated a rupture under the very surface of the planet. In an act of desperation, Hulk leaped into the molten earth and forced the splitting plates back to their proper assemblage, literally saving Sakaar. The Hulk gave the King a finishing blow, knocking him clear of the city walls. Finally, the Wildebots came upon the Red King and finished him off once and for all. |||| |||| Hulk was proclaimed the Green King, and all those on Sakaar worshiped him and his Queen, Caiera. She told her king that she would bear him a child, and it seemed that the Hulk's life of running and fighting was over. However, the Hulk was not destined for a happy ending as the ship that brought him to that world soon exploded, killing his wife and unborn child sending Banner into a rage like no other. He and his Warbound journeyed to Earth seeking revenge on the planet's heroes for their part in Sakkar's destruction. Once they arrived, the Hulk crushed Black Bolt on Attilan and took the city of New York as his battleground. Iron Man, Mister Fantastic and Doctor Strange all fell before the Hulk and his Warbound too. Even old sparring partners such as the X-Men as well as new threats like the Gamma Corps couldn't even slow the Hulk's rampage. |||| |||| Hulk fitted his defeated foes with Obedience Disks just like the ones he and the other gladiators on Sakaar were forced to wear and made them battle one another in order to experience the ordeal he was put through. It wasn’t until the Hulk prevented Mister Fantastic from killing Tony Stark during one of the gladiator matches that he revealed his true intentions. Hulk claimed he came home for justice, not murder, but Hulk does not want the world to forget what he feels their heroes truly are: liars, traitors and killers. No matter how many times Stark or Richards try to explain they had nothing to do with the shuttle explosion that killed his adopted home world, the Hulk will not listen. |||| |||| Soon a nearly insane Sentry arrives on the scene and a cataclysmic battle ensues between him and Hulk. Sentry unleashed forces that nearly destroyed what was left of New York, but ultimately, Hulk averted that disaster by defeating the Sentry. Having reverted back to the form of Bruce Banner, it seemed that World War Hulk had come to an end. However, Miek had other plans. Miek tried to injure Banner, so he would transform back to his gamma powered counterpart, but Rick Jones pushed Banner out of the way only to have Miek’s spear thrust through his body. Miek got what he wanted, and Banner did turn back into the Hulk but it was only because he intended to destroy the Hive King for stabbing his friend. Miek continued to explain how it was really his plan to let Hulk think the heroes of Earth destroyed Sakaar as he watched men loyal to the Red King load an old warp core onto the Hulk’s shuttle in hopes that it would kill him. Now faced with the truth, Hulk’s anger was completely out of control, and as he told the heroes he would hate them forever because this would never have happened if not for their interference, he also told Tony Stark to stop him because he hated himself as well for his part in the destruction. |||| Stark called upon the combined power of various satellites to finally put an end to the Hulk’s rampage. Banner was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and was placed three miles below the Mojave Desert. The Warbound was also placed in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but they escaped after saving New York from being split in half by an expanding chasm the Hulk created."

A socially retiring young man, he developed his scholastic side, concentrating especially on the sciences.  During a trip to a scientific exhibit, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, and incident which grants him a variety of spider-related powers, including greatly enhanced strength and reflexes, increased durability and healing, and the ability to cling to surfaces as he chooses.  While Peter initially attempts to use his new capabilities to make money on the professional wrestling circuit, he soon has to confront much deeper issues in his life.  After Peter neglects to stop a burglary in progress, thinking that he need not get involved, the criminal involved ends up killing his Uncle Ben.  As a result, Peter vows to use his abilities to fight crime, motivated by his Uncle's words, 'With great power there must also come great responsibility.'  Equipping himself with wrist-mounted web shooters of his own design, he becomes Spider-Man. |||| |||| Through high school and college, Peter battles a number of criminals and superhuman enemies, all while helping support his aunt and his education as a photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper, and while publisher and chief editor, J. Jonah Jameson, works to discredit Spider-Man, often using Peter's own pictures. In college, he meets and falls in love with Gwen Stacy, a fellow student. Tragically, Gwen is later killed by Peter's enemy, the Green Goblin, an event that becomes a touchstone in Peter's life.  Before this relationship, and afterwards, Peter pursues an on-again, off-again relationship with Mary Jane 'MJ' Watson, a childhood acquaintance. |||| |||| At one point, after a travel in space related to the Beyonder's Secret Wars, Spider-Man returns to Earth with a new black costume that enhances his abilities and generates its own webs without the need of separate devices. After several strange occurances with the costume, he seeks help from Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. From Reed, Peter learns that it is in fact a symbiotic alien life-form and, with help from Reed, separates himself from it. In doing so, however, the life-form becomes filled with hate and Peter creates one of his most powerful enemies, as the symbiote goes on to bond with a number of other individuals, and spreads further, creating monstrous foes like Venom and Carnage. Around the same time, Peter and MJ are married and, after MJ is attacked by Venom, Peter gives up his black costume (now simply cloth), since its appearance frightens his wife. |||| |||| In recent years, Peter has supported himself in civilian life as a public school science teacher, while MJ has pursued a successful modeling career.  While the couple fall on some rocky times, they remain together to this day.  Peter's life as Spider-Man has undergone a number of changes, especially related to recent events in which he confronts the vampire-like Morlun, who sees Peter as somehow related to a supernatural spider-spirit.  Battling Morlun, Peter is maimed and apparently killed, but after a period of hibernation in a cocoon-like shell, he returns with enhanced strength and a number of more obviously spider-like powers, including organic web spinnerets. |||| |||| During the crisis of the Super-human Registration Act, Peter initially takes the side of Tony Stark, and reveals his identity to the larger world.  However, he comes to regret his decision, and his allegiance to Stark, and turns against him.  This turns Peter and his family into fugitives, during which time May is seriously wounded in an assassination attempt, leading Peter to re-don his black costume.

Among the many energy forms she has assumed are cosmic rays, gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, electricity, infrared radiation, microwaves, radio waves and neutrinos. She is invisible and intangible in many of her energy forms (the most frequent exception being visible light), and is capable of flight in all her energy forms (reaching velocities up to and including light speed). She also has the ability to project these energies from her body while she is in human form, usually in the form of energy blasts from her hands; a variation of this ability enables her to project light-based holographic illusions. When she encounters a new or unfamiliar energy, Pulsar can often duplicate it given enough time for analysis, such as when she replicated and drained the verdant will-powered energies of an extra-dimensional emerald gladiator. Pulsar tends to be physically insubstantial in her energy forms, though with concentration and effort she can sometimes perform tasks such as briefly grasping an object, either by partially solidifying or by applying some sort of force to the object in question.",,"Monica Rambeau has always been devoted to serving and protecting the public, both as herself and in her various costumed guises. Before she became one of the brightest stars in the age of marvels, Monica Rambeau was a dedicated lieutenant in the New Orleans harbor patrol, partnered with the daring John Audain. Monica's life changed when old Rambeau family friend Professor Andre LeClare came to her for help; he had developed an other-dimensional energy-tapping device with financial support from South American dictator Ernesto Ramirez, who intended to use LeClare's technology to create incredibly dangerous weapons. Ramirez had already begun adapting the technology for his own purposes with the aid of scientist Felipe Picaro, but LeClare and Rambeau joined forces to destroy Picaro's prototype. In the process, Rambeau was bombarded by the device's extra-dimensional energies and gained the power to convert her own body into energy and back again at will. LeClare urged her to use this power as a crimefighter, and she left the harbor patrol to become a full-time adventurer. |||| |||| Dubbed Captain Marvel by the media, Rambeau sought out the Avengers for help in mastering her new powers and became a member-in-training of their group. Befriended and mentored by Avengers veterans Captain America and the Wasp, Monica soon graduated to full membership, serving a lengthy stint during which she became one of the team's most valuable and respected members. One early complication was the memory of an earlier Captain Marvel, the legendary alien warrior Mar-Vell, a deceased honorary member of the Avengers. Rambeau felt awkward about inheriting his title after she learned of his existence, but she retained the name since the Avengers and others regarded her as a worthy heir to Mar-Vell's heroic legacy. Another new Avengers recruit, Mar-Vell's close friend Starfox (Eros), disapproved of Monica using the Captain Marvel name at first; but even he was soon impressed by Monica's character and ability, giving her his blessing and saluting the new Captain Marvel. |||| |||| As an Avenger, Monica faced foes such as Maximus, the Enclave, Annihilus, the Lava Men (who mistook her for the divine Lady-of-Light of their legends), Morgan Le Fay, the Dire Wraiths, Maelstrom, the Skrulls, Kang, Attuma, Freedom Force, an insane Quicksilver, Tyrak, and Grandmaster's Legion of the Unliving, even battling an army of Earth's major super-criminals during the Beyonder's Secret Wars alongside many of Earth's foremost heroes. Two of Monica's earliest recurring enemies were super-powered psychiatrist Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who became one of Monica's bitterest foes, and Moonstone's powerful pawn Blackout (Marcus Daniels), who wielded the eerie Darkforce. Captain Marvel first encountered them when the Avengers opposed the duo's escape from incarceration in Project: PEGASUS. The pair would later return as members of Baron (Helmut) Zemo's Masters of Evil, participating in an occupation of Avengers Mansion and trapping Monica in the Darkforce dimension; but Captain Marvel escaped in time to help retake the Mansion during a series of skirmishes that left Moonstone temporarily crippled and Blackout dead. Another of Monica's major early foes was the murderous interstellar pirate Nebula, who shanghaied Monica into space for an extended period before she was reunited with the Avengers; but while Monica's adventures spanned space and time, she remained one of the most down-to-Earth Avengers. Her powers allowed her to make frequent visits to her native New Orleans, where she maintained a close and loving relationship with her parents. She even started a charter fishing business, eventually working on the water alongside her father, a retired firefighter and Monica's original heroic inspiration. |||| |||| When an exhausted Wasp stepped down as Avengers chairwoman, Captain America nominated Captain Marvel to replace her as team leader. Though she was overwhelmed at the prospect, Monica accepted the post and filled it quite capably at first, even seeing the team through a conflict with the Olympian gods; however, Monica became increasingly uneasy in her new role, a situation made worse after ambitious new recruit Doctor Druid began undermining her leadership. Finally, when honorary Avengers member Marrina transformed into the gigantic sea monster Leviathan, Captain Marvel led the hunt for the creature; during the battle that followed, Monica made contact with sea water while in her electrical form and accidentally conducted herself across the surface of the ocean, depleting her energies so gravely and dispersing her atoms so widely that she could barely regain physical form, emerging as a frail, withered husk of a woman devoid of super-powers. Forced to retire from the team, Monica fought her way back to health and eventually regained her powers, though in a reduced and altered form that allowed her to surround herself with a manipulable energy field. She resumed crimefighting, facing foes such as Brazilian crimelord Kristina Ramos, Moonstone, Powderkeg, the Sons of the Serpent, the Blue Marvel and the alien Starblasters. At the same time, she served as a cargo ship captain in her friend Ron Morgan's shipping company before starting her own charter business. Her original powers gradually regenerated, fully returning after the alien Stranger helpfully accelerated the process. |||| |||| Monica has yet to return to the full-time Avengers roster, but has stayed connected with the team and served often as a reservist, sometimes assuming leadership duties in the absence of the current chair. She helped repel an Atlantean invasion, opposed the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, chaired a reserve substitute roster during the team's first United Nations-backed reorganization, led an Avengers delegation to the Shi'ar empire during the Kree-Shi'ar war, played a key role in overthrowing the alternate reality tyranny of Morgan le Fay (Monica being one of only a few heroes whose sense of Avengers spirit was strong enough to overcome Morgan's mind-warping magic), battled the Wrecking Crew, advised troubled new recruit Triathlon, led an ad hoc squad of Avengers in saving the galaxy from relocation by the Infinites, helped contain Bloodwraith, fought Lord Templar & Pagan, faced the Triple-Evil, helped liberate Earth from the forces of Kang, battled The Order, assisted during the Scorpio crisis, and was one of many Avengers who confronted an insane Scarlet Witch. Rambeau also helped staff the Avengers' deep space monitoring station in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, being one of the few Avengers who could commute there with ease. For a time, Monica's mother was intercepting her Avengers calls since she feared for her daughter's safety and wanted Monica to spend more time with her ailing father, but Monica soon put a stop to her mother's meddling. Whether she will work with the newly reorganized Avengers at some point remains to be seen. |||| |||| When the late Mar-Vell's offspring Genis became an adventurer, he soon became known as Captain Marvel like his father before him-which Monica resented at first. After she and Genis teamed up to defeat the Controller, Genis tried to concede the Captain Marvel title to Monica since he felt she was more worthy of it; but Monica declined out of respect for the Mar-Vell legacy, impulsively adopting a new costumed alias as Photon. More recently, Genis-physically and mentally transformed after a near-death experience and wanting to establish a new identity for himself distinct from his father-started calling himself Photon. Monica confronted him, tensely at first, but the two Photons ended up brainstorming super-hero names over coffee. Neither one of them wanted to become Captain Marvel again given all the baggage associated with the name, but Monica decided to let Genis keep the Photon alias after she came up with a name she liked better: Pulsar. A hero by any name, Monica remains one of the most formidable adventurers of her generation. |||| |||| Recently Monica has taken up the leadership mantle of the rogue superhero squad Nextwave and played a stellar role in helping Black Panther, Luke Cage, Blade, and Brother Voodoo rid her native New Orleans of an infestation of vampires."

Whereas most Atlanteans can swim at a speed of 30 miles per hour, Attuma can swim at 60 miles per hour. Like all Atlanteans, Attuma cannot breathe air out of water.

Believing he is that conqueror, Attuma has launched numerous attacks on the city of Atlantis and its regent Namor the Sub-Mariner. |||| |||| Unable to best Namor in personal combat, Attuma has frequently taken allies to further his ambitions. These alliances have also met with defeat. The first time Attuma attacked Atlantis, the Fantastic Four aided Namor in repulsing his attack. In recent years, Attuma has battled the Avengers as well. Not renowned for his intelligence, Attuma has frequently employed renegade Atlantean and human scientists. One of them created the Octo-Meks, octopus-shaped fighting machines. Another proposed that he mate with human mutants in order to produce a sire stronger than Namor himself. Toward this end he abducted the mutant Phoenix, but she thwarted his plans. Although Attuma has never been able to claim a lasting victor over Namor, he was a party to the death of Namor's bride, Lady Dorma.

She is at least 5,000 years old and became legendary around 1,300 B.C., when the Greek hero Odysseus and his crew, fresh from the Trojan War, came to her island Aeaea. Sersi transformed Odysseus' crewmen into pigs for attempting to menace her. Odysseus, however, managed to ward her off with the aid of the goddess Athena, and Sersi turned his men back to normal. Odysseus spent a year on Aeaea; she also encountered Odysseus' son Telemachus when he came following his father's path. Centuries later, Sersi still considered Telemachus to be the love of her life. |||| |||| |||| Over the centuries Sersi often interacted with humans, visiting Rome during the reign of Nero, helping Merlin expose an imposter (Merlin Demonspawn) in Camelot, visiting France during the French Revolution, and befriending the English poet Thomas Chatterton. |||| |||| |||| In recent years, the Celestials returned to Earth to judge humanity, the Eternals, and their other creation, the Deviants. Sersi became involved in the struggle, enjoying the adventure, but caring little for combat. By this time, Sersi had become a famous entertainer in New York, hosting parties at her loft for film stars, super heroes and other influential people. She often entertained with her powers, which her normal human guests believed to be stage magic. Sersi's super-hero friendships eventually led her to join the Avengers in search of adventure and romance, first pursuing Captain America and later the Black Knight. Sersi was a sublime yet powerful teammate until she was driven insane by Proctor, an alternate-reality Black Knight whose Earth had been destroyed by his world's Sersi. Sersi eventually slew Proctor and left the Avengers, operating in the extra-dimensional Ultraverse for a time before returning home and regaining her sanity. She continues to live in New York, occasionally aiding the Avengers and her people against their foes, but preferring her life as a socialite."

He is, however, in excellent condition, and is possessed of better-than-average acrobatic and marksmanship skills.",,"Rip Hunter and his pal Jeffrey Smith were at college working on their doctorate when they formulated a theory of time travel and began work on their first time sphere. They were hoping for a grant to help them complete their work, but they had a brilliant rival in John Charles James, who was creating a new type of rocket engine. |||| The one thing that stood in the way of success for Rip and Jeff was the need for a power element that would not melt. Miraculously, they found it on a slag heap. Years later, James stole their backup time sphere in an attempt to change the past so he would win the grant. Rip’s team stopped him, but it appears a power element was lost from the stolen sphere – and was the very one Rip later found. Thus, James actually insured his defeat rather than stopping it. |||| |||| Having won the grant, Rip and Jeff continued working on the sphere. Just what they did while experimenting on the first sphere is not recorded, but after earning their doctorates, they found a way to duplicate the power element and built a second sphere. By this time the team had been increased by the addition of Bonnie Baxter, a recently graduated history major, and her kid brother, Corky. |||| |||| After a shakedown cruise to the Mesozoic Era – the Dinosaur Age – they set up business, making time journeys to clear up historical puzzles. The sphere contains their Encyclo-Matic, a computer filled with historical data they may need. Eventually, they added uniforms with various devices they could use in emergencies. Most important are the speech-translation disks that allow them to converse with people of every era and country. |||| |||| The group appears to have been independently wealthy, as they usually charged nothing for quests in the interest of science. |||| |||| Finally, with new improvements, Rip Hunter began the ultimate journey – to the birth of the universe! But when he and his crew arrived, they found a strange temple. An unearthly noise struck their ears and all passed out – to awaken back in their own time, incredibly aged! |||| |||| Eventually, they were contacted by Immortal Man, who was recruiting for the Forgotten Heroes. It seems Vandal Savage had discovered the temples all these heroes had seen and was making use of them. Rip and his crew accompanied Superman into the past to destroy the first temple, which also destroyed the rest, and Rip and the others were restored to their proper ages."

Scorpio went after his brother, Nick Fury, with his new group, but was defeated by The Defenders and Moon Knight. |||| |||| The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by Quicksilver during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destory The Avengers for their imagined wrong doings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody. |||| |||| The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. |||| |||| At some point the android Zodiac captured and presumably killed the human Scorpio, Jacques LaPoint. Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration.

14840,Sam Burke,,14840_20100608102808_char.jpg,,,"Detective Sam Burke is often interpreted as the brawn of the group. Sam is a large, headstrong man with a penchant for foul language and gruff behavior. Sam is usually the one to take 'action' against any type of villain they encounter. Though Sam has often been accused of police brutality, the charges have never stuck. In fact, Sam takes great pride in being one of the few honest cops in a precinct he sees as infested with corruption and scandal. Although his style with criminals is rough, and he comes across as boorish to most others, he's actually quite compassionate, beneath his rough exterior, to those in need. He has a real passion for doing the right thing and seeing justice done, even if he has to resort to not-so-civil means. Sam is very protective of those few he trusts and considers friends, especially his partner Twitch. Twitch's dedication to his work despite the corruption of the Police department is shown to be inspiring to Sam, and he often goes to great lengths to protect Twitch from even their fellow officers, who may mean verbal or physical harm to Sam's highly intelligent, diminutive partner. |||| |||| Despite his down-and-dirty, cynical, and hot-tempered personality, Sam is essentially a good man, with a strong sense of duty and honor. His straightforward ways have often put the detective duo at odds with even their fellow police, but while Twitch is considerably more reasonable than his larger partner, (and often pokes fun at Sam's fiery temperament and statements) he shows a deep trust and respect for him as well. While Twitch often figures out and solves the duo's various cases and predicaments, Sam is unquestionably the drive and conviction which sees the two through. |||| |||| While Sam himself grudgingly admits that Twitch is considerably better at marksmanship and calculated strategies, many often make the mistake of thinking Sam as dumb or all talk, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Sam is quite intelligent, and although he isn't a calculating genius or a complex thinker like his partner, Sam can actually be extremely insightful of other people. Sam can often see right through deception and get to the bottom of people's actions. There are even some times where he sees truth in things not even Twitch can see. He's also very sharp and streetwise. Despite being quite overweight, as Sam's passion for his work is matched only by his enormous appetite, Sam is very tough as well, and has proven to be quite a fighter, more than a match for many of the criminals they come across in a straight forward fight."

68,Magneto (Marvel),Erik 'Max' Magnus Eisenhardt/Lehnsherr ,68_20051111055713_char.jpg,"Magneto possesses the power to control all forms of magnetism. He can shape and manipulate magnetic fields that exist naturally or artificially. It is unclear, however, whether he must draw magnetic force from outside himself (if so, then he can do so over vast distances), or whether he can also generate magnetic force from within himself. Nor is it clear whether Magneto's power is psionic or purely physiological in nature. Magneto's power is, for all practical purposes, limitless. Moreover, he can use his magnetic powers in more than one way simultaneously. He can completely assemble a complicated machine within seconds through his powers. He can erect magnetic force fields with a high degree of impenetrability around himself for protection. |||| |||| Although Magneto's primary power is control over magnetism, he can also project or manipulate any form of energy that is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism, since it's more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. Magneto has also exhibited powers of astral projection and telepathy, and has claimed to be able to control the minds of others, though his abilities along these lines appear to be minimal. |||| |||| Magneto's ability to wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical condition. When severely injured, his body is unable to withstand the strain of manipulating great amounts of magnetic forces",,"After witnessing the brutal murder of his family by the Nazis, the man known as Magnus was sent to the Auschwitz death camp where he served in the Sonderkommando, the squad of Jewish men forced to helped their Nazi masters operate the gas chambers, ovens, and fire pits of the camp. While in Auschwitz, Magnus met a gypsy girl named Magda. Magnus and Magda survived the Holocaust, and later were married. They had a daughter, Anya. Magnus first consciously used his mutant powers when his family was trapped in a burning house. Unable to rescue his daughter from the blaze due to his inexperience, coupled with interference from a mob of angry humans, he angrily unleashed his powers to vengefully slaughter the humans. Terrified, Magda left him, and months later discovered that she was pregnant. Magda presumably died after giving birth to mutant twins at Wundagore Mountain. To shake off his pursuers, Magnus had master forger George Odekirk create the identity of Sinte gypsy 'Erik Lehnsherr' for him. Magnus eventually made his way to Israel where he worked as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital near Haifa. He befriended Charles Xavier, with whom he shared lengthy debates, hypothesizing what would happen if humanity were to be faced with a race of super-powered beings. The pair ultimately revealed their true natures to each other when they prevented Nazi war criminal Baron Wolfgang von Strucker from obtaining a large cache of Nazi gold. Causing a cave-in that seemingly killed Strucker, Magnus realized that his and Xavier's views on mutant/human relations were incompatible and left with the gold. Fearing another Holocaust, he took an aggressive and lethal stance against humanity. Magnus has often expressed the belief that mutants, whom he calls Homo-sapien-superior, will eventually be the dominant life form on the planet, and has wavered between wanting to exist in harmony with humans, wanting a separate homeland for mutants, and wanting to enforce his superiority over all humanity. |||| |||| Calling himself Magneto, Magnus banded together a group he dubbed the Brotherhood of Mutants, later referred to as 'Evil' by the media. Among the assembled members were his children, now the mutants Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Magneto soon found himself opposed by Xavier and his own group, the X-Men. After a battle against the X-Men and the Avengers, Magneto was presumed dead, but managed to survive by using his powers to burrow through the ocean floor into a series of caverns that led him to the secluded Antarctic prehistoric jungle of the Savage Land. There, he used his knowledge of genetic engineering to mutate local savages into super-powered beings he dubbed the Savage Land Mutates. Soon after, Magneto was again opposed by the X-Men, and was once more presumed killed in an explosion. Yet again, Magneto survived, finding himself in the Savage Land city known as the 'Land of the Dead' where he discovered a mind-numbing gas that he intended to use against mankind. He projected his astral self to the native peoples, manipulating them into building an airship filled with the gas. His plan was once again foiled by the X-Men, and he fled into the ocean. Rescued by the Mutate Amphibius, Magneto was taken to an island, where Sauron was working on a machine to tap the geothermal energies of the region. Magneto realized that the device could help restore his ailing powers, but was once again opposed by the X-Men and believed dead. |||| |||| Rescued by Namor the Sub-Mariner, Magneto was taken to Atlantis, where he quickly subjugated the Atlantean army and launched an attack on the surface world. He was opposed by the Fantastic Four, who used a feedback machine to trap him in a cone of his own power. Later freed, Magneto continued his genetic experiments and, using technology abandoned by the Inhumans Phaeder and Maelstrom, he created Alpha, whom he dubbed the 'Ultimate Mutant'. Alpha turned on his creator, however, reducing Magneto and the Brotherhood to infancy. The baby Magneto was transferred to Muir Island, where geneticist Moira MacTaggert attempted to control Magneto's insane rages by manipulating his DNA so that his body would be better able to tolerate his powers. Magneto was later restored to adulthood by the Shi'ar alien Eric the Red, and initially his psychotic and destructive behavior seemed to return when he attacked the new team of X-Men off of Muir Island, and then kidnapped them, holding them prisoner under a volcano in Antarctica. After battling the X-Men in Antarctica, Magneto retreated to Asteroid M, where his mind began to heal, and MacTaggert's genetic changes began to restore his sanity. Magneto next tried to hold the world hostage to force world peace and disarmament, destroying a Russian city after warning the population to evacuate. He also sank a Russian submarine with all hands on board after the vessel attacked him. The X-Men once more stopped Magneto, but during the battle Magneto almost killed the young mutant Kitty Pryde, an act that shocked him, and forced him to reevaluate his life. Following the inadvertent destruction of Asteroid M by the extraterrestrial Warlock, Magneto crashed to Earth and was rescued from the ocean by fishing boat captain Aletys 'Lee' Forrester who took him to an island within the Bermuda Triangle to recuperate. There, Lee experienced Magneto's 'human' side and the pair had a brief romance. A remorseful Magneto then turned himself over to the World Court to be tried for his crimes, and would have certainly been found guilty if not for the intervention of Fenris, the twin children of Baron Strucker, who sought revenge against Magneto and Xavier for their intervention in their father's plans years earlier. The courthouse was destroyed, and Magneto and Xavier were left alone as Xavier's body deteriorated beyond repair. After Xavier's love Lilandra arrived with the space pirates the Starjammers to heal him with Shi'ar technology, Xavier made Magneto promise to protect their dream and take over as Headmaster of his School. Magneto reluctantly agreed, and came to supervise the fledgling New Mutants team while also joining the X-Men on missions. |||| |||| Seeking an alliance with the Hellfire Club against ever-increasing threats to them both, Magneto and the X-Men's leader Storm briefly shared the position of White King within the Club's Inner Circle before philosophical differences between Magneto and the Club's Black King Sebastian Shaw resulted in Shaw deposed as leader and Magneto assuming the unique position of 'Grey King'. Magneto later returned to the Savage Land to oppose the priestess Zaladane, who had usurped control of the Mutates. While preparing for the inevitable confrontation, Magneto saved the X-Man Rogue from a twisted version of Ms. Marvel, and then teamed up with her, the Savage Land's protector Ka-Zar, and the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to defeat Zaladane. Despite protestations from Rogue, Magneto slew Zaladane before retreating to his rebuilt Asteroid M. There, he was approached by a group called the Acolytes, who begged him to intervene in the civil war between mutants and humans on the island nation of Genosha. Magneto agreed, and when the X-Men intervened, the Acolytes captured them and they were brought to Asteroid M to be 'reprogrammed'. The process was a failure, however, and during the ensuing battle, Magneto was severely injured. The Acolyte Fabian Cortez, who claimed to be healing Magneto, was actually using his power-amplification ability to mask Magneto's pain, weakening him in the process. Cortez further betrayed his lord when he triggered the nuclear missiles Magneto had set up around the asteroid. It took all of Magneto's power to keep the base from blowing up, but the damage was too severe. While the X-Men escaped, Magneto and the remaining Acolytes crashed to Earth. Months later, the wreckage was discovered, but Magneto was missing. He later returned, stronger than ever, to a larger, more fanatical following of Acolytes, and co-opted the remains of Graymalkin, the space station belonging to the mutant future soldier Cable, into a new orbital base he called Avalon. When Magneto threatened the Earth once more, Xavier and the X-Men journeyed to Avalon where, after physically pulling all of the Adamantium out of Wolverine's body, his mind was wiped by Xavier and he remained on Avalon in a vegetative state. When a battle between the extra-dimensional Holocaust and the Acolytes' new leader Exodus destroyed Avalon, then-Acolyte and former X-Man Colossus placed Magneto in an escape pod which crashed to Earth. |||| |||| For a time it was believed that the man called Joseph was a rejuvenated Magneto, but this theory was disproved when, after the X-Men were returning from an intergalactic mission, Magneto forced their spaceship to crash in Antarctica near his old base and, posing as Erik the Red, placed Gambit on trial for his role in the infamous mutant Morlock Massacre. Upon sentencing Gambit, Magneto destroyed his former base and left, leaving the X-Men to ponder the revelations about Gambit. He then went back into hiding, emerging only briefly to kill the forger Odekirk. After a few more weeks of preparation, Magneto launched his next offensive in the form of an electromagnetic pulse that spread across the globe. This time, he was attacked by Astra, a former member of the original Brotherhood and the creator of Joseph, who was revealed to be a clone created after Astra found and healed Magneto following the fall of Avalon so as to use his DNA. She intended for the clone to kill Magneto, but he proved too resourceful and was only injured while the clone became amnesiac. Astra had Joseph attack Magneto while he was controlling the Earth's magnetosphere, which severely disrupted Earth's magnetic field and forced Magneto to fight against becoming pure electromagnetic energy. The intervention of the X-Men distracted him, however, leaving Joseph to fix the magnetosphere. Magneto was briefly subdued by the X-Men as Joseph made the ultimate sacrifice to destroy his template's machines, but before the battle could resume, the United Nations offered Magneto sovereignty over Genosha in return for some security considerations and a promise never to initiate hostilities against the nations of the world. Magneto accepted, but subsequently discovered that his powers were again failing him. |||| |||| Magneto set about consolidating both his mutant and political power, but faced opposition from the renegade Mutate Zealot, his son Quicksilver, and Rogue. After Magneto defeated Zealot's forces, Rogue left, and he had his Acolyte Voght manipulate Quicksilver into staying as a member of the cabinet, in the hope that he would at last learn to be a loyal son. Soon after, Magneto was revealed to be a member of the Twelve, a group of mutants supposedly destined to usher in a golden age for mutant-kind. He and the others were captured by the eternal mutant Apocalypse, who sought to usurp the power of the Twelve for himself; however, Magneto's weakness short-circuited the machine. In the ensuing clash, Magneto discovered that he could commandeer the magnetic powers of the mutant heroine Polaris and use them as his own. When Apocalypse was defeated, Magneto returned to Genosha with Polaris, and began teaching her to expand her control, while using her as a front for his own power. Over the next six months, Magneto managed to rebuild much of the war-torn country, but a rebellion in Carrion Cove proved a thorn in his side. The rebels had discovered technology in the city that they felt could not be allowed to fall into Magneto's hands, namely a genetic manipulation chamber from the process once used to create the Genoshan Mutates which would allow Magneto to restore himself to full power. Though the U.N., rogue Acolytes, Cortez, the Avengers, and Polaris all opposed him, Magneto tore down the city as a distraction to allow him to access the chamber and restore his DNA, making him more powerful than ever before. |||| |||| With an army of mutants at his disposal following the deadly Legacy Virus being cured, Magneto declared war on mankind. Yet again, Magneto was opposed by the X-Men, and in the ensuing clash he was severely injured by Wolverine. Recuperating, Magneto was powerless to prevent Sentinels controlled by Xavier's genetic twin Cassandra Nova from decimating the island. Magneto was again believed dead, and after a recording purported to contain his last words was found, mutant supremacist ideals became widespread in the mutant community, with some adoring him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto seemingly returned with a vengeance, infiltrating the Xavier Institute as the mutant healer Xorn, co-opting the Special Class as his new Brotherhood, and launching an attack on Manhattan. Killing Jean Grey before being killed in turn by Wolverine, it was later revealed that this Magneto was an imposter. The true Magneto was still in Genosha, where he joined Xavier in rebuilding the shattered nation. Following the dissolution of the Avengers after the Scarlet Witch suffered an apparent breakdown, Magneto rushed to her aid. When the X-Men and a new Avengers team met to discuss her fate, it seemed as though Magneto coerced her into altering reality, creating a world where mutants were the dominant species and lived openly without fear with himself as ruler. It was later revealed that Magneto's son Quicksilver was the one who actually convinced the Scarlet Witch to alter reality, in an attempt to appease their father, as well as the X-Men and Avengers who threatened to put the Scarlet Witch down. Following the events of 'M-Day,' Magneto has apparently lost his mutant powers. Rather than kill him, Wolverine decided to let him live the rest of his life as the thing he hates the most... a human."

13,Angel (Marvel)(03 - Warren Worthington III),Warren Kenneth Worthington III ,13_20051203110123_char.jpg,"Angel has fully feathered wings that span 16' and have a very flexible skeletal structure. He can fly by flapping his wings, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph. Though he generally flies below the height of clouds at 6,500 feet, Angel can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Angel's entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. |||| |||| Angel is a skilled combatant, especially in aerial hand-to-hand combat. He is also a talented businessman whose wealth ranks him in the lower part of the Fortune 500 list. |||| |||| See the entry on Archangel for information on his secondary mutation. ||||",,"Warren Worthington III was born in Centerport, New York to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington Jr. He was attending a private school in his adolescence when white, feathered wings began to grow from his shoulder blades. At first Warren felt he was a freak, but he soon learned that he could use his wings to fly and to help people. When there was a fire in his dormitory, he borrowed some props from the school's drama department, dressed up as a 'heavenly' angel and rescued his friends. He soon learned that he in fact is a mutant. He donned a mask and costume and called himself the Avenging Angel and was a solo adventurer originally. |||| |||| He then began attending the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters, where Professor Charles Xavier trained young mutants to control their powers and use them for good. Taking the code name Angel, Worthington became one of the original members of the superhero team the X-Men. |||| |||| For a time, he was romantically interested in Jean Grey, but eventually he realized that Jean was in love with Scott Summers and gave up the pursuit. |||| |||| While pursuing Sauron in the Savage Land, Angel was attacked by Pteranodons and fell to his death. He was brought back to life by an uncostumed Magneto, who was known as Creator in the Savage Land. Presumed dead, Magneto had been gathering a mutant army. |||| |||| When the original X-Men were captured by the mutant island Krakoa, Professor X created a new team of X-Men to rescue them. When this new team of X-Men decided to stay, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of Cyclops, left the team. He and Iceman went to Los Angeles, where they founded the Champions with Hercules, the Black Widow, and the original Ghost Rider. Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops' subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoined the X-Men to help pick up the slack. During this time, Angel grew increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of Wolverine, and after some time quit the team in protest. |||| |||| He was once kidnapped by the Morlock leader Callisto and stripped of most of his clothing. Callisto attempted to humiliate him. He could not remember anything else at the time as he was unconscious. Just then, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Sprite arrived to stop Callisto, but they were also captured by the Morlocks and tied to stakes. Storm struck a deal with Callisto: a battle to the death without powers. They would duel with knives, with the winner keeping Angel and having the leadership of the Morlocks. Storm won, but spared Callisto's life. Shortly thereafter, Angel joined the Defenders. |||| |||| The Defenders did not last much longer with Angel, Iceman, and Beast being the sole survivors. They had decided to abandon the hero's life, but with the resurrection of Jean Grey, the five original X-Men chose to form X-Factor. During this period, Warren found himself giving Jean more emotional support than Cyclops was, who was going through intense emotional repercussions while trying to deal with the fact that Jean was still alive in conjunction with his own involvement with Madelyne Pryor (who was later revealed to be a clone of Jean). |||| |||| Archangel |||| |||| Much later, having joined his teammates as a member of X-Factor, Warren's wings were severely damaged during the Mutant Massacre by Harpoon. Cameron Hodge—whom Warren had known for years and considered a friend, yet was secretly anti-mutant—had his wings amputated. Despondent over the loss of his wings, Warren escaped the hospital and commandeered his private jet, which exploded in the air as the rest of X-Factor watched helplessly from below. It was revealed that Hodge had sabotaged Warren's ultralight airplane to create the illusion that the depressed Warren had tried to commit suicide. |||| |||| Before the explosion, Warren was spirited away by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. Apocalypse altered Warren's appearance, giving him blue skin, organic metal wings, and the ability to fire his metal feathers as projectiles. He also gave him the title of Death, the leader of his Horsemen. When it appeared as though Death had killed his former teammate Iceman, he overcame Apocalypse's brainwashing. Hungry for revenge, he tracked down Hodge. Hodge had kidnapped Warren's lover, Candy Southern, and killed her. Warren beheaded Hodge with his wings, seemingly killing him (it was later revealed that Hodge's head still lived in the X-Tinction Agenda crossover). Warren did not rejoin X-Factor immediately afterwards, spending some time as a loner called 'Dark Angel' due to his state of mind following Southern's death. After the events of Inferno, he finally rejoined X-Factor, taking the name Archangel at Beast's urging. It was around this point that he became romantically involved with Charlotte Jones, a New York City Police officer who helped to rescue Warren and the rest of X-Factor from the Ravens, a cult of near-immortal psychic vampires. |||| |||| After rejoining the X-Men, Archangel became romantically involved with Psylocke. Warren soon traded in his 'Death' garb for his old blue and white costume, signifying he was attempting to put his dark days behind him. After Psylocke was eviscerated by X-Men prisoner Sabretooth during an escape attempt, Warren and the X-Men tracked down and captured him, but not before he was able to badly damage Warren's metal wings. Over time, the damage to his wings spread. Eventually the metal wings shattered completely, revealing that his feathered wings had been growing back within them and broke them apart from the inside. This followed a visit from Ozymandias, who told him that he was indeed one of Apocalypse's chosen ones. Reclaiming his original codename Angel, Warren still retained his blue skin color. Having both experienced drastic changes in their lives, Psylocke and Warren found themselves growing apart, while Psylocke began showing attraction for new X-Men recruit Thunderbird. Realizing they were no longer on the same path, Warren ended their relationship, wishing her happiness in the future. |||| |||| Warren remained a member of one of the core X-Men teams, where he served as co-leader with Nightcrawler. In a fight with Black Tom Cassidy, Angel experienced a 'secondary mutation'. His blood gained advanced healing properties, giving him the ability to heal quickly from wounds and allowing him to heal others when his blood is mixed with theirs. This new power 'healed' Warren's skin from Apocalypse's alterations, turning his blue pallor back to its original shade. Warren discovered his ability to heal others when he saved the life of teammate Husk (Paige Guthrie) after she was severely injured in battle. He has since become involved in a controversial romance with Paige, who is several years his junior. It was also revealed during The Draco storyline that his blood dealt much pain to Nightcrawler. Also in the same storyline it is hinted by Azazel, Nightcrawler and Abyss's father, that Archangel may actually be related to an ancient civilization of Angel like mutants who had banished Azazel and his people from Earth into another Dimension. Apparently this is the same dimension through which Kurt a.k.a Nightcrawler passes through while teleporting. |||| |||| Warren and Paige took an extended leave of absence, and Archangel launched a charity called 'Mutantes Sans Frontières' in Zanzibar, (a reference to Doctors Without Borders), where he then proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby Genosha. In 'Excalibur,' Warren met up again with Callisto. As Paige reminded Warren of his history with Callisto, Viper attacked. Warren and Callisto then managed to defeat Viper together. In Generation M, it appeared that Angel's wings had shrunken and shriveled into a useless state following the events of House of M. However, it was revealed that Warren had managed to fake losing his mutant abilities in order to lure out The Ghoul, a deranged serial killer who uses his retained mutant powers to murder ex-mutants. |||| |||| Archangel joined with fellow former Champions member Hercules, along with Namora, and Amadeus Cho to attempt to calm down The Hulk in the Incredible Hulk #107. In their attempts to help save New York City from the destruction, they form a new team of superheroes, called the Renegades."

Amora prefers to use sorcery and seduction. Few can resist her beauty, particularly when she augments it with her magic; a single kiss is often enough to make a man her slave. She is one of the most powerful mystics in Asgard or on Earth, capable of energy blasts, protective shields, illusions, levitation, teleportation, conjuring, interdimensional travel, transmutation, time-disruption and mind control. As her sorcerous powers stem largely from Asgardian sources, her magic is strongest within the realm of Asgard and gradually diminishes the longer she remains outside of Asgard, though her powers never fade completely.",,"Amora the Enchantress, An Asgardian Goddess and immensely powerful magical sorcerer. Being backed by years of experience, she is one of Thor's greatest and most powerful foes not only because of her immense power, but also because of him being her love interest. |||| |||| *** SILVER AGE *** |||| Amora first appeared as a foe of Thor, albeit with the intention of seducing him and then soon after as an enemy of the Avengers. |||| |||| The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she has a sister by the name of Lorelei. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by now well renowned beauty did not hinder in this. |||| |||| Amora has devoted her immortal life to the pursuit of power and pleasure, using sorcery and sexuality as her tools. Born into the Asgardian gods, Amora studied under the mighty sorceress Karnilla The Norn Queen, who ultimately expelled her for being too undisciplined. Amora went on to study under many other Asgardian mages, often seducing them to learn their secrets. By the time she reached adulthood, Amora was a powerful sorceress, famous for her beauty and infamous for her heartless scheming. An early alliance with the warrior goddess Brunnhilde the Valkyrie ended with Amora trapping Brunnhilde's soul, using the Valkyrie's vacated form as a shell for herself and various pawns to inhabit over the centuries that followed. Brunnhilde would eventually return, becoming one of Amora's bitterest enemies. |||| |||| Amora's longest-serving pawn was Skurge The Executioner. Skurge was madly in love with Amora, who granted him just enough affection to ensure his loyalty. The two pursued many schemes together, often coming into conflict with the thunder god Thor and his mortal comrades, the Avengers. When Skurge eventually sacrificed his life aiding Thor in an heroic rescue mission, Amora mourned him with a genuine grief that surprised everyone, including the Enchantress herself. |||| |||| Other smitten pawns such as the original Power Man (Erik Josten) and a new, human Executioner (Brute Benhurst) never served the Enchantress quite so well as Skurge, and were soon abandoned. Pardoned in recent years after helping defend Asgard against Surtur, Amora has had an on-and-off romantic link with her longtime foe Thor, to whom she was drawn even more strongly after he inherited the throne of Asgard. As Thor's ally, advisor and sometime lover, Amora has been a prominent figure in Thor's Asgard. Sadly, Amora was among the many Asgardians apparently slain when Thor's brother Loki led a revolt in fulfillment of the Ragnarok prophecies. Whether she will rise again remains to be seen."

The effects range from moving small items around, to flight, to creating havoc with the earth's tides and earthquakes. She can also induce an effect called 'Lunar Madness' in others, which can manifest as anything from traumatic flashbacks to being driven permanently insane.",,"Hugh Klein was an American Astronaut on Apollo XXV, the last manned Moon mission. While on the Moon, Hugh discovered an ancient structure, thereafter referred to as the 'Lunar Villa'. Inside, Hugh finds an infant girl in a cradle, and is then confronted by a ghostly consortium identified as The Hundred. Caelius, speaker for the Hundred, explained how they were a group of scholars and philosophers devoted to peace who fled Rome during the time of the emperors. Using alchemical processes, they created the Lunar Villa and attempted to create a champion of their peaceful ideas on Earth. Unfortunately, they accidentally created the villain known as the Centurion instead. To atone for this mistake, and to perpetuate their beliefs, they created a child they called the Praemonstra Supra, meaning 'She Who Will Point the Way'. Hugh returned to Earth with the infant child, and he and his new wife, Jenny, were allowed to adopt and raise the infant, whom they named Laura. |||| |||| Although Laura exhibited no outward super powers, she was always a brilliant and athletic child. When Laura turned 16, her powers of gravity control manifested.

At this point Laura embarked on her career as Laurel, the Moon Maiden. |||| |||| She soon made many friends among the superhero community, was an early member of the Justice League, and shared at least one adventure with the Teen Titans.

After erasing several notable heroes from existence, Moon Maiden, along with the remaining members of the Justice League, the Teen Titans, and Infinity Inc. took the battle to the Centurion, in what was known as 'The Century War'. In an act of self-sacrifice, Moon Maiden, took herself and the Centurion high into the sky, and there destroyed his weapon, causing a great explosion, and removing the two of them from history. Only Hugh Klein was able to recall his daughter and the events that had occurred. |||| |||| Moon Maiden eventually returned, wrapped up in the schemes of the also returned Centurion. Hugh was able to rekindle the memories of Laura's friends in the Justice League, and together they were able to free her from the Centurion and she was able to bring a close to his scheme.

4964,Shark (DC)(02 - Green Lantern villain),,4964_20130415034417_char.jpg,Various mental powers,,"Years ago, the radiation of an atomic pile transformed a tiger shark into a humanoid shark creature with vast mental powers. The powerful but bloodthirsty being became a threat to humanity, battling Green Lantern Hal Jordan, Superman, the JLA, and others over the years. In disguise of an Atlantean called Karshon, he usurped the throne of Poseidonis before being defeated by Aquaman. During the so-called Crisis, Guy Gardner recruited the Shark and other villains to fight the armies of Qward. However, the Shark soon returned to his villainous ways, fighting Jordan, Black Condor (II), and Aquaman again. When last seen, the Shark had once again devolved into a normal tiger shark, due to the telepathic powers of Aquaman."
210,Wonder Woman (DC)(Post Crisis)(03 - Hippolyta),"Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons ",210_20060623234639_char.jpg,,,"Queen of the Amazons, the late 20th-century version of Diana's mother has been a much bigger part of the Wonder Woman back-story than just the worried mother sending her only daughter off to the 'world of men'.  In this version, her political role as Queen of the Amazons has been shown in greater detail, replete with battlefield leadership, questionable politics, and surprising twists. In an effort to make sense of JSA continuity in the post-CRISIS DCU, most of Diana's Golden Age appearances have been retconned to have happened to Hippolyta. Indeed, this version donned the Wonder Woman outfit more than a few times -- and paid the political price at home for doing so. The 'retconned Golden Age Wonder Woman' was far from an abstraction; she appeared as Wonder Woman early in the 1999 run of JSA - and other places - in wholly new adventures. Unfortunately, though, she is currently dead. Thanks to her theoretically long stint as Wonder Woman, however, stories set in most years of the 20th century would likely see Hippolyta return to comics as Wonder Woman. Use this character if the story in question explicitly refers to Hippolyta as the one wearing the bracelets. Wonder Woman's history is so confusing post- Crisis that the only way to reliably navigate is to use the character actually present in the issue, rather than the one that 'probably was wearing the suit, given the events of Crisis '."
665,Wizard (Marvel),Bentley Wittman ,665_20070318193819_char.jpg,"Wittman is a scientific genius, particularly in the fields of applied physics and sub-atomic particles. His Anti-Gravity Discs can lift several hundred pounds each, and can be remotely controlled via relays in his armor. His gauntlets (alternatively referred to as Power Gloves or Wonder Gloves) can unleash potent electrical blasts or use directed gravitational fields to increase his strength. His armor provides him with protection from assault, and devices in his helmet allow him to control the minds of others. |||| |||| The strength he can gain from his Wonder Gloves is unknown. Suffice to say, when he constructed one for Imus Champion in an appropriate size, the villain was able to hurt both Thor and Hyperion in battle.",,"Bentley Wittman grew up possessing near-superhuman levels of genius and, as an adult, became an inventor of great renown, selling his futuristic inventions to the wealthy and becoming quite rich. He became known as the Wizard by legally assuming this stage name and using his advanced scientific inventions to perform feats of 'magic.' |||| |||| Intellectually bored, however, he decided to defeat Johnny Storm, who had just appeared to the world as the Human Torch. Pretending to be a victim, he was rescued by the Torch and invited him to his high-tech, futuristic mansion on Long Island where he captured the Torch with ease. The Wizard then impersonated the Torch, launching a crime spree to destroy the Torch’s reputation, before being captured by the Fantastic Four and sent to prison. |||| |||| The Wizard clashed many more times with the Human Torch until the conclusion of one encounter sent him flying uncontrollably upward by one of his anti-gravity discs, unable to descend safely. He was rescued by two other adversaries of the Torch: the Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete (soon after, the Trapster). After he suggested they team up, a suggestion by the Trapster inspired him to form a team that would be a criminal counterpart to the Fantastic Four, with himself, his two rescuers, and Medusa, who was then suffering from amnesia; becoming the Frightful Four. |||| |||| The Frightful Four proved to be one of the most formidable menaces that the Fantastic Four had yet encountered. The Frightful Four raided the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building headquarters, and affixed the Wizard's anti-gravity discs to the four - minus Johnny, but with Alicia Masters, who managed to alert the Torch with the Invisible Girl's flare gun. Johnny soon appeared and forced the Wizard to use his anti-grav ship to free his team members before they floated into airless space. Then, together they beat the Frightful Four until the Wizard and the Sandman exploded the Wizard's ship as a distraction, and escaped. Later, kidnapping the Invisible Girl, they lured the Fantastic Four to a Pacific atoll where they rigged an experimental 'Q-bomb' to detonate. The Fantastic Four narrowly escaped. Weeks later, the Frightful Four made their third attempt. Capturing the Thing, the Wizard used his 'Id Machine' to simulate the Thing's natural tendencies toward violence and brainwash him into obeying the Wizard's commands. The Fantastic Four finally managed to subdue the Frightful Four, then all but Medusa were turned over to the authorities. |||| |||| In his continued quest to crush the Fantastic Four, the Wizard has tried many iterations of the Frightful Four. He twice brought Medusa back into the ranks, but, as she was no longer a criminal, having since regained her memories, she betrayed them both times. He also never succeeded in finding a permanent replacement for her. His first choice, Thundra, also ended up allying herself with the Fantastic Four as Medusa did. Others who joined the team for a time included Electro, Llyra, and the Brute (Reed Richards of the original Counter-Earth). When the Sandman appeared to give up his life of crime, the Wizard formed a new team with Hydro-Man, Klaw, and Titania. But however formidable, the Frightful Four have always been thwarted by their heroic counterparts. |||| |||| Very rarely has the Wizard operated outside of the Frightful Four. Once, he formed a partnership with Mysterio, but was foiled by Spider-Man. Another time, he teamed up with the Plantman to escape prison and ran into a conflict with the Avengers. He was later broken out of prison by Loki to join the inner circle of villains organizing the Acts of Vengeance against the Avengers, but they were sorely defeated. Often avoiding the limelight that he once embraced, the Wizard hoped to hide from authorities using his former name Bentley Wittman. He was found by the Thunderbolts, however, who convinced the Wizard to provide anti-gravity discs in order for them to battle Graviton and, later, to attach to the Magneto Protocol Satellites. Later still, when the Sandman had appeared to reform his criminal ways, the Wizard took it upon himself to subject his former ally to his id machine, re-integrating the Sandman’s mind and restoring him to villainy. |||| |||| Finally, when the Fantastic Four’s popularity reached an all-time low, the Wizard decided it was time to re-form the Frightful Four once more. No longer motivated by petty jealousy, the Wizard believed the Fantastic Four to be the source of all his troubles, his fall from grace. He rescued the Trapster from the Negative Zone, boosted the powers of Hydro-Man, and called upon his ex-wife, Salamandra, to round out the Frightful Four. He also manipulated Cole, his and Salamandra’s daughter, to develop a relationship with the Human Torch in order to teleport to her and bypass the Fantastic Four’s defenses. During the resulting battle, the Wizard turned on the Trapster, revealing that he intended Cole to be the next member of the Frightful Four. When the Frightful Four defeated the heroes, the Wizard flaunted his success on television and left them humiliated. However, when the Wizard admitted that he only wanted to include Cole once he saw her exhibit superhuman powers, she turned on him. She sought out the Fantastic Four to lead them back to her father and to try to find a cure for her powers. The Wizard and Cole confronted each other, and Cole used one of the Trapster’s traps to ensnare her father, then used her powers over gravity to bring the Wizard’s lair down around him. |||| |||| He has since returned, alive and well, in Fantastic Four #546, with a Frightful FIVE ( Titania, Trapster, Hydro-Man, and Klaw)."

He once worked for the CIA but ultimately left in disgust with their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake. He later became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the Sons Of Liberty, who outfitted him with the costume and weaponry he uses as Agent Liberty. In the beginning, Lockwood used his Agent Liberty guise to help the Sons' stated cause of overturning the current governmental regime, which brought him into conflict with Superman; however, when the Sons' leadership asked him to perform an assassination of politician Pete Ross, Lockwood refused, and left the Sons to go solo. During his time working with the Sons, Agent Liberty also briefly assisted the Justice League against the villain Brainiac in the crossover Panic in the Sky. |||| |||| Lockwood helps bring down the Sons by sending vital information to the reporter Clark Kent. |||| |||| Lockwood learns that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was in actuality his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never undertake that identity again. |||| |||| However, he does take it up later. At one time, unwillingly, as one of many brainwashed victims of a cult started by the villain Brainiac.[2] Agent Liberty and the other kidnapped meta-humans are rescued by Huntress and Vixen.

148,Annihilus (Marvel),Annihilus ,148_20051203110334_char.jpg,"Annihilus is capable of self propelled flight. He can withstand the vacuum of space. He wears armor that grants him resistance to most forms of injury (extreme temperatures, ballistic force, bullets, etc.) His armor is actually an insectoid exoskeleton with some armor components. He is superhumanly strong; the upward limit of what he can lift is just under 50 tons. |||| |||| Annihilus wields the Cosmic Control Rod, a weapon of great power. It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to manipulate the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting destructive energy of up to 10 megatons of TNT. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder. |||| |||| Though Annihilus has knowledge of technology centuries beyond what is known on Earth, his intelligence is only above average compared to normal humans; he is not an original thinker. |||| Retrieved from 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilus' |||| |||| Category: Fantastic Four villains",,"Annihilus is an opponent of the Fantastic Four, who lives in the Negative Zone (another dimension) where he is monarch. Annihilus is an enemy of Blastaar, another enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is a member of an insectoid race and possesses alien technology far in advance to what is encountered on Earth. He is armed with a unique and powerful weapon, the Cosmic Control Rod. Mister Fantastic once travelled to the Negative Zone and took the Cosmic Control Rod to save the life of his unborn son, Franklin Richards. |||| |||| Annihilus has survived certain death on numerous occasions; while his body has been destroyed, he has been reborn again from within his original body into a smaller weaker state, one which quickly grows into his former self, complete with a new cosmic control rod. |||| |||| On another trip to the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Annihilus was again killed, this time by Hellscout, a member of a group of pilgrims who had been sent to the Negative Zone on their crossing to America from England. The pilgrims had him confused for a demon because of his appearance. He was in an extremely weakened state and appeared to be near the end of his life when this occurred. Annihilus reappeared in the 2005 comics mini-series Fantastic Four: Foes with a duplicate who he was fighting for control of the Negative Zone. |||| |||| In the Blink limited series, Annihilus became involved in a brief romantic relationship with the Age of Apocalypse version of Blink. This was presumably the Age of Apocalypse Annihilus from an alternate dimension. |||| |||| The conflict between the two Annihilus spawn, however, seems to have been resolved, as it appears one of them- the other presumably deceased- is now leading the Annihilation Wave, an enormous fleet of Negative Zone battleships, ostensibly claimed to have the goal of conquering the universe. He claims that the universe is expanding into areas of the Negative Zone, making the universe now rightfully his territory. His forces have already destroyed the Kyln, an intergalactic power station and maximum security prison, and the planet Xandar, headquarters of the Nova Corps. He has since gained the aid of Thanos, and two beings that were trapped in the Kyln by Galactus, Tenebrous and Aegis. Tenebrous and Aegis then managed to defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer, and the two are connected to a giant mechanism in Thanos' starship. It has now been revealed that Annihilus' goal is actually creating a massive Power Cosmic bomb with which to destroy the Universe and the Negative zone, leaving Annihilus the only survivor. Drax, however, with the help of the Silver Surfer, manages to free Galactus, who then nearly annihilates the Annihilation Wave, with Galactus, The Silver Surfer, Nova, Phyla-Vell, and Star-Lord, and the surviving Annihilus the only beings still alive in the area. Nova then has a final battle against Annihilus, in which Phyla manages to steal away the Quantum Bands, and Nova then finally kills Annihilus, by shoving his fist down his throat and ripping out his internal organs. |||| |||| In the epilogue, however, Annihilus' surviving general of his armies, Ravenous, is seen taking a newborn egg for one of the last surviving queen insects, and holding a fetal looking bug in it, proclaiming 'THE LORD ANNIHILUS LIVES!' |||| |||| He also leads an elite personal guard, The Centurions, 100 super-powered aliens, each from a different Negative Zone world. They are extremely loyal to him and form a devastatingly effective army."

Mia is rescued from one of her clients, a depraved local politician, by Oliver Queen, who had just recently returned from the dead.

He possesses vast superhuman strength and a high degree of invulnerability with some resistance to cold, heat, fire, corrosives and toxins. (When the Wrecking Crew believed their enchantment was fading, they sought augmentation by geneticist Arnim Zola, who used scientific means to restore their power.)",,"Henry Camp was a U.S. Army master sergeant who turned to crime after being discharged. While in prison at Ryker’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin and Brian Calusky, the four managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Franklin became Thunderball, Calusky became Piledriver, and Camp became Bulldozer. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, Bulldozer and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, appearing with them in all their endeavors, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and Bulldozer was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s power away from the others who divided it, and Bulldozer was left powerless. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Bulldozer was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated. The entire Crew received a power boost when hired by Arnim Zola to battle the Thunderbolts (unaware that the Thunderbolts included many of their former allies in the Masters of Evil). |||| |||| The Wrecking Crew appeared together for various endeavors: hired by the likes of the Doomsday Man, battling heroes such as the Avengers and the Warriors Three, used as lackeys by Morgan Le Fay, among others.

54,Impulse (DC)(01 - Bart Allen),Bartholomew 'Bart' Allen ,54_20080519193410_char.jpg,,,"Suffering from a hyper-accelerated metabolism, Bart Allen was aging at a faster rate than that of any human being thus causing him to appear the age of twelve when he was chronologically only two years old. To prevent him from developing mental health problems he was raised in a virtual reality machine which created a simulated world that kept pace with his own scale of time. When it became clear that this method was not helping, his grandmother, Iris Allen, took him back in time to the present where The Flash, Wally West, tracked him down in a race across the world. By forcing Bart into an extreme burst of speed, Wally managed to shock his hyper-metabolism back to normal. Because he had spent the majority of his childhood in a simulated world, Bart had no concept of danger and was prone to leaping before he looked. The youth proved to be more trouble than Wally could handle, and he was palmed off onto retired superhero speedster Max Mercury, who moved Bart to Manchester, Alabama. As retconned in Impulse #50, Batman named him 'Impulse' as a warning, not as a compliment. |||| |||| Bart joined the Titans early in his career before going on to become one of the founding members (along with Robin and Superboy) of the superhero team Young Justice. For a time, Impulse became the owner of a spaceship granted to him by a rich sultan in appreciation for having helped save his castle. The team used this ship to reunite Doiby Dickles with his queen and restore the rightful rule of Myrg. Impulse stayed with Young Justice for an extensive period of time during which he developed the ability to make speed-force energy duplicates. This allowed him to be in multiple places at once. The newly acquired power proved useful until one of the duplicates was killed during the 'Our Worlds at War' storyline when half the team was lost on Apokolips. Bart quit Young Justice temporarily as the death of his duplicate led him to come to terms with his own mortality. |||| |||| Following Max Mercury's disappearance, Bart was taken in by Jay Garrick, the first Flash, and his wife Joan. After the breakup of Young Justice, Bart joined some of his former teammates in a new line-up of the Teen Titans."
1805,Baron Zemo (Marvel)(02 - Helmut Zemo),Helmut Zemo ,1805_20060309183927_char.jpg,"Zemo's aging has been slowed by periodic immersion in Compound X. |||| |||| He is a gifted scientist. Though not an inventive genius, he is a capable engineer and a talented problem-solver, highly adept at understanding, modifying, and manipulating existing technologies. He is a fine marksman with handguns and an expert swordsman. |||| |||| He sometimes wears circuitry in his hood guarding against psychic assault, and occasionally uses weapons or traps incorporating his father's Adhesive X, which forms an unbreakable bond with any substance unless it is subjected to a special solvent. Zemo has recently usurped Karla Sofen's moonstones, alien power gems which enable him to manipulate energy on a massive scale for effects such as strength/durability augmentation, space warp creation, gravity manipulation, light manipulation, molecular phasing, and more.",,"Helmut Zemo was born to greatness-and great darkness. Both legacies began with Harbin Zemo, a minor official in the small town of Zeulniz who single-handedly fought off a band of Slav raiders in 1480. Rewarded with a title as the first Baron Zemo, Harbin became legendary for his bravery, but he also became infamous for his grandiose ego and bloodthirsty temper. In the early 20th Century, scientific genius Heinrich Zemo became the twelfth Baron Zemo. Heinrich and his wife Hilda had a son, Helmut. Born in the 1930s, Helmut spent at least part of his youth in Berlin, developing a fondness for American popular culture imports such as horror films, comic books and movie serials. |||| |||| |||| Meanwhile, Heinrich became a leading scientist and special agent in Hitler's Nazi regime, inventing an early laser beam (his 'death ray'), the super-durable Adhesive X, the age-retarding Compound X, and more. While his loving family worshipped him, Heinrich quickly became one of the most despised enemies of the Allied powers, and was also widely disgraced in his own country after a defeat by America's Howling Commandos. Hated and feared both at home and abroad, Heinrich began wearing a hooded disguise almost constantly; he also began going mad, especially after his hood was permanently glued to his head by Adhesive X during a battle with the Allied super-agent Captain America. As Heinrich grew more unstable, he became abusive toward his family. Hilda died helping Captain America thwart Zemo's Medusa Effect scheme, but Helmut remained loyal, helping his father battle the Captain and the hero's young partner Bucky Barnes during that same incident. |||| |||| In 1945, Baron Zemo seemingly slew Captain America and Bucky and went into hiding in the Amazon, carving out his own private kingdom with the aid of a mercenary army (including Erik Josten in recent years) and an enslaved native population. In Heinrich's absence, Helmut led a more normal life for decades, studying science and becoming an engineer. Summoned to visit Heinrich's Amazon stronghold, Helmut watched his father ruthlessly crush a native uprising, saw Josten's fanatical devotion to the Baron, and heard Heinrich boast of killing the World War II freedom fighter Citizen V (John Watkins); Helmut was disturbed yet intrigued. Roughly one year later, news of Captain America's survival led to a series of clashes between the Captain (backed by the Avengers) and the Baron (backed by his Masters of Evil). After Heinrich accidentally killed himself during a battle with Captain America, Helmut blamed the Captain for destroying their family. Studying and replicating some of Heinrich's inventions and undergoing combat training, Helmut eventually attacked Captain America in the costumed guise of the Phoenix, also battling the Captain's new partner the Falcon. In the end, Zemo was accidentally knocked into a vat of Adhesive X. |||| |||| Helmut survived, but with hideous facial scars. As the new Baron Zemo, he targeted Captain America with the aid of his android ally Primus and various mutates created by Zemo's mad geneticist associate Arnim Zola, such as the rat-man Vermin. Zemo also began menacing the Captain's friends, notably Arnie Roth. Barely escaping with his life after Vermin turned on him, Zemo formed an alliance with Nazi mastermind the Red Skull and his daughter Mother Night, allowing them to mentor him in the ways of evil as they launched a series of attacks on Captain America and his friends. Zemo soon wearied of both his subordinate status and his mentors' indiscriminately hateful worldview, so he turned against his allies. Narrowly surviving a psychic assault from Mother Night, the Baron decided to avenge the loss of his family by destroying Captain America's adopted family, the Avengers. Zemo recruited the largest Masters of Evil team yet and led them in occupying Avengers Mansion, capturing and torturing several of the occupants. The Avengers soon retook the Mansion, and Zemo suffered a crippling fall in battle with Captain America. |||| |||| Later, aided by the mercenary Batroc's Brigade, Zemo battled Captain America and others on a futile quest to resurrect Heinrich with the Bloodstone. Further injured in another fall while escaping, Zemo subsequently tried to press Vermin and the other mutates back into his service, but Spider-Man opposed him, and Vermin ultimately turned on him viciously again. Sometime thereafter, Helmut married the Zemo-inspired terrorist known as the Baroness, who had once claimed to be Heinrich Zemo resurrected in female form. As the Baron and Baroness Zemo, the couple abducted a host of neglected and abused children to create an instant family for themselves, but Captain America freed the children and captured the Zemos with the aid of Diamondback (Rachel Leighton) and Free Spirit. |||| |||| After Heike reportedly died in prison, Zemo had begun to reassemble his Masters when the Avengers (including Captain America) were seemingly slain by Onslaught. Deprived of his greatest foes and his guiding obsession, Zemo finally began to accept the fact that his father had destroyed himself, and that his own obsession with destroying Captain America was ultimately pointless. Shifting his focus from vengeance to power, Zemo led his Masters in masquerading as the Thunderbolts, a new heroic super-team replacing the Avengers, accumulating public trust and resources until they were ready to strike. Zemo himself posed as the new Citizen V in a mockingly ironic nod to Heinrich's old victim. The deception lasted for months, until Zemo used a mind-influencing bio-modem to subjugate much of the planet. Most of the Thunderbolts had grown to like their roles as heroes, though, so they turned against Zemo and foiled his plot, despite his use of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four as mind-controlled pawns. Savagely beaten by his teammate Moonstone (Karla Sofen), who resented Zemo for squandering the potential of their heroic pose, Helmut escaped with the reluctant aid of Thunderbolts member Atlas (Erik Josten), paying his debt to the Zemo family). |||| |||| Partnered for a time with the robotic Techno, Zemo repeatedly sought revenge on the Thunderbolts. However, he gradually realized that Moonstone was right about his having wasted the group's early potential, and decided it might be better to manipulate the world rather than openly rule it. Stalked by the new Citizen V (Dallas Riordan), who sought to destroy him for tainting the Citizen V legacy, Zemo escaped her but was later killed in his own headquarters by the government assassin Scourge (Jack Monroe). |||| |||| However, Zemo's consciousness survived thanks to a failsafe device engineered by Techno, transplanting Zemo's consciousness into the comatose body of adventurer John Watkins III, the previous Citizen V (true heir to the original). Posing as a revived Citizen V, Zemo reluctantly served the V-Battalion, helping to foil Baron Strucker's mind control conspiracy (of which Scourge had been an unwilling agent). When Strucker's daughter Andrea realized who Citizen V really was, Zemo slew her. For a time, Citizen V led a government-sponsored team of super-agents known as the Redeemers. When Graviton slaughtered the Redeemers, Citizen V teamed with the Thunderbolts to save the world from Graviton, though the battle hurled almost all the Thunderbolts into the Franklin Richards-created Counter-Earth. Zemo's disembodied consciousness went with them, now inhabiting the tech-pack of Fixer (Techno reborn in his original human form), then usurped the body of Counter-Earth’s Helmut Zemo with the Fixer's aid. |||| |||| Reborn in an unscarred facsimile of his original body, Zemo at first hoped to conquer Counter-Earth, but reluctantly joined the team's efforts to save the world rather than rule it, slowly coming to regard the business of world-saving as an intriguing and rewarding challenge. Already influenced by his stints with the Thunderbolts and the Redeemers, as well as his time within the brain of John Watkins III, Zemo had begun to show tiny sparks of nobility. He and the other Thunderbolts were soon regarded as beloved heroes by the people of Counter-Earth. |||| |||| Zemo's Thunderbolts were thrown back to their native Earth while saving both worlds from an all-consuming void. They accomplished this with the aid of a new team of Thunderbolts that Hawkeye and Songbird had organized on Earth in their absence, and the two factions of Thunderbolts soon assembled to decide their collective future. Though deeply suspicious of Zemo, Hawkeye was soon convinced that Zemo at least had the desire and potential to reform, and Hawkeye believed he could trust the other Thunderbolts to keep an eye on him. With this in mind, Hawkeye and several others left the group, and the remaining Thunderbolts reorganized under Zemo's leadership. Zemo even began to develop a romantic interest in Moonstone, though whether it was ever mutual is unclear. |||| Zemo's new Thunderbolts soon became internationally celebrated heroes. However, none of the team fully trusted Zemo, and the Avengers regarded him with even greater suspicion, planting Tony Stark in the Cobalt Man suit as a spy within his group. When the Thunderbolts created the global energy-absorbing Liberator project, the Avengers uncovered evidence of a secret failsafe designed to steal its power, and assumed it was Zemo's handiwork. However, when the Avengers interfered in the Liberator's test run, the failsafe turned out to be created by Moonstone. He accidentally absorbed the Liberator energies and went on a power-mad rampage stopped by the combined efforts of both teams, though not before Zemo's face had been horribly scarred again - ironically, while shielding Captain America from Moonstone. In the end, Zemo's Thunderbolts broke up, Moonstone was left comatose, and Zemo absconded with Moonstone's vastly powerful alien gemstones. He has since worked behind the scenes to manipulate the new Thunderbolts without their knowledge, pursuing goals as yet unknown."

However, when his brother, David, was killed in action shortly after taking on the role of Starman, Jack was forced into taking up the cosmic rod in order to protect Opal City and bring his brother's killer to justice. Since then, he imperceptibly came to love his role as Opal's protector, and found that he enjoyed being a hero. Recently, he embarked on a year-long quest in space to find Will Payton, his girlfriend Sadie's brother and a former Starman. He was eventually successful in his quest, but did not bring Payton back to Earth since the latter discovered he may be the reincarnation of an alien prince. |||| |||| Jack agreed to be a member of the Justice Society after the mission to ensure Fate's reincarnation, but following events in Opal City which kept him away for some time, he reconsidered and become a reservist, called in when the group was in desperate need of additional firepower. Later still, following the death of his father, and Sadie's announcement that she was pregnant, he decided to step down from the heroic world altogether in order to rear his two children (the first having been sired without his knowledge when he was raped by the Mist), passing the cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, the current Star-Spangled Kid."

473,Night Thrasher (Marvel)(01 - Dwayne Taylor),Dwayne Taylor ,473_20050925140753_char.jpg,,,"Dwayne Taylor grew up believing his rich parents were killed by criminals for some unexplained reason. Taylor's guardians, the ex-military sergeant Chord (a friend of his father's) and the elderly martial arts master Tai, supported Taylor's vow to make all criminals pay for their actions, helping him create the identity of Night Thrasher. |||| |||| Taylor trained hard to be a skilled fighter. On his first outing, he met Midnight's Fire and Silhouette. These two superhumans were taking out criminals by gaining their confidence and then busting them. Giving his name as Night Thrasher, Taylor joined them on their crusade. One night, while Silhouette was infiltrating a gunrunning operation, the police accidentally came upon them. Scared that the police were fixing to shoot his sister, Midnight's Fire started to throw a blade at them. Taylor stopped him before he had a chance to throw it, and a gun battle erupted. Silhouette was hit and badly injured in the spine. Taylor, who had fallen in love with Silhouette, was heartbroken, as was Midnight's Fire. Midnight's Fire swore to get revenge on Taylor someday. Taylor left them, believing that Silhouette was dead. |||| |||| Realizing that he needed more of an edge, Taylor trained even harder. Using his parent's Taylor Foundation, Taylor had Chord provide him with a state-of-the-art headquarters, training facilities, and computer support systems. He also had developed specialized armor and weaponry. Taylor then decided to create a special team so he would have some backup. He recruited several young heroes and formed the New Warriors. |||| |||| Shortly after they formed the team, Midnight's Fire made an appearance and tried to frame Taylor with the murder of two policemen. In a final battle with Midnight's Fire, Taylor overcame his fear of his nemesis and beat him in a battle. Taylor then discovered that Silhouette was still alive but crippled. She renounced her brother's actions, turning him in to the police and joining Taylor in the New Warriors. |||| |||| After the Warriors thwarted a plot by the criminal scientists of A.I.M., Taylor discovered a link between A.I.M.'s benefactors and the Taylor Foundation. With some investigation, he discovered dozens of illegal operations and shady business practices performed by the Foundation, linking them with criminal industrialist Gideon and the Japanese Yakuza syndicate, among others. Taylor used the Warriors to seek out the truth in confronting the Yakuza, but the team balked at making a deal with criminals. Taylor refused to budge, and the argument led him to quit the New Warriors. |||| |||| Taylor was then approached by the criminal team Folding Circle, of which Midnight's Fire was a part, since they promised to lead him to the truth of his past. In doing so, it was revealed that Taylor's father, while in Vietnam, was captured by Tai, who was a powerful sorcerer guarding an ancient temple. Tai had coerced Taylor's father and others in his military unit, including Chord, to have children with the women of the temple, in order that their children would later be sacrificed in the temple's mystic well of dimensional energies and thereby give Tai even greater power. Chord and Taylor's father tried to thwart this plot, and Chord was thus mystically ensorcelled to kill Taylor's parents. The Folding Circle was comprised of the children of Tai's prophecy, but it was assembling its members too early for Tai's wishes. The New Warriors, investigating Night Thrasher's activities, tracked the Circle to the Vietnamese temple, where they joined Folding Circle in a climatic battle with Tai. Ultimately, Tai was seemingly slain by the very energies she tried to master. |||| |||| Taylor rejoined the New Warriors and served with them for a long tenure. He left the team eventually, rededicating himself to his role as chairman of the Taylor Foundation, although he would team up with them when the need arose. Later, Taylor decided to give up adventuring altogether, becoming a full-time director of the Taylor Foundation. He believed that true battles for justice would be fought in the boardrooms. He moved to the Seattle branch of the Foundation, seemingly disbanding the New Warriors. |||| |||| Over time, however, the New Warriors reassembled without Taylor's help. Even so, as the Warriors continued to use equipment and facilities associated with the Taylor Foundation, he was able to monitor the new version of the team. He even rejoined them briefly against the assassin Junzo Muto and agents of the Hand. |||| |||| More recently, the Taylor Foundation suffered a massive downfall when its funding of cancer research banked on the efforts of Zachary Smith. Smith’s cure was revealed to be nothing more than his mutant son’s subconscious help. The Foundation’s stock tanked and Smith abandoned his son, but Dwayne Taylor stepped in to adopt the young mutant, now Microbe. However, it would require more creative solutions to save the Foundation. Night Thrasher made a deal with shady television executive Ashley Brothers to avoid bankruptcy, but this also forced the New Warriors into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Hoping to make the best of the situation, the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. |||| |||| The Warriors enjoyed mixed success and popularity, but the show was officially cancelled and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Even so, the Warriors were able to return and continue their reality-TV efforts. However, when they hoped to boost their ratings by apprehending a quartet of villains holed up in Stamford, Connecticut, tragedy struck. During the battle, Nitro used his power to cause a massive explosion. It killed Night Thrasher, the New Warriors, and almost everyone in the vicinity."
1552,Star-Spangled Kid (DC)(01 - Sylvester Pemberton),Sylvester Pemberton ,1552_20070121203604_char.jpg,"No meta-human powers.  Excellent physical conditioning and hand-to-hand fighting skills.  First adventured solely on these skills along.  After a time, however, he started to use a semi-retired Starman's cosmic rod.  Later, he employed the 'cosmic converter belt', which had the same basic functionality of the rod.  Still later, the belt was depowered, allowing him only to fly.","He's just a guy in a suit, at the end of the day.","When someone at Pat Dugan's auto-repair shop mentioned that they wished the American flag could come to life on the battlefield and kick some Nazi ass, Sylvester Pemberton got an idea.  Having gained some confidence in hand-to-hand combat with Nazi agents at a local movie theatre, he decided to make a costume that resembled the American flag, and begin a double life as a 'man of mystery'. |||| |||| He teamed with a reluctant Dugan, who had taken the name 'Stripesy' and had already begun adventuring on his own.  (Like Pemberton, Dugan has been inspired by the comments of the man in his auto repair shop.)  This partnership that would rarely be seen separately.  Oddly, the Kid was the lead hero, and Stripesy, his sidekick--despite the fact that Pemberton was very much younger than Dugan.  This was perhaps for classist reasons:  Pemberton was from a very wealthy family and Dugan was 'just' a mechanic.  Indeed, when not in uniform, Dugan became the Pemberton family chauffeur. Pemberton seemingly spent all of his career looking for a home among other superheroes.  He initially went with the the All-Star Squadron, then the JSA, then the original Seven Soldiers of Victory, then formed Infinity, Inc. |||| |||| His exact time line is open to some debate, however, as it appears different when viewed by publication date rather than by the internal DCU calendar. |||| |||| Moreover, his own personal chronology is significantly muddled by the fact that, as a member of the Seven Soldiers, he was apparently thrown back in time 50,000 years, then brought back to the 20th century many years after he had left it.  He may have additionally spent some portion of his later life on Earth 1, rather than his native Earth 2. |||| |||| In adulthood, he would become known as 'Skyman'--but that's genuine trivia, as the bulk of his stories occur as the 'Star-Spangled Kid'."

368,Black Adam (DC)(Post Crisis),Teth-Adam ,368_20070317133049_char.jpg,,,"In this revised origin (told in Power of Shazam! #10), Teth-Adam was the son of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses II, and impressed one of the high priests, the wizard Shazam, with his good deeds. The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (Horus), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of Aton, and the courage of Mehen. |||| |||| Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter Blaze in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery and, as a result, unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's de-powered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse. |||| |||| Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of Rameses II, where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero was referred to as 'Khem-Adam' ('Black Adam'). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam went several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name. |||| |||| The original Power of Shazam! graphic novel (which predated the publication of the series by a year) explained how Black Adam was revived and introduced into the modern world. In this story, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, an archaeological dig financed by the Sivana Foundation to excavate the tomb of Rameses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam became obsessed with the artifact, and killed both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping Egypt, Theo Adam soon made his way back to America. |||| |||| The Batsons' son, Billy, had been left behind in the United States, and was soon appointed to become Captain Marvel, the second champion of the wizard Shazam. When Theo Adam first encountered Captain Marvel, he noted both Marvel's identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore had a revelation, and realized that he was a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam spoke the wizard's Shazam's name and was transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam revealed himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battled. Captain Marvel emerged victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brought Theo Adam to Shazam, who wiped Adam's memory and took away his voice, so that he could not access his powers."

However, he needed an element known as Vibranium, which only existed in a small African country known as Wakanda. In order to obtain the needed amount, Klaw hired a group of mercenaries and traveled to Africa in search of it. He found the Wakandan tribe and their leader, T’Chaka, guarding the vibranium, which was part of their sacred mound. Klaw demanded that they give up the mound, but they refused and he ordered his men to kill T’Chaka. They gunned the chief down in front of his young son, T’Challa, who had never before witnessed gunfire. Klaw then used his superior weaponry to massacre the tribesmen and burn down their village. In response, T’Challa stole Klaw’s sound-blaster from one of Klaw’s men and turned it on him, shattering his hand. |||| |||| Incensed by the Wakanda’s retaliation, Klaw returned to the Netherlands and vowed to return one day to exact revenge. To that end he created a sonic gun he called a force glove to replace his hand. Exactly ten years later, Klaw returned to Wakanda to find T’Challa in the guise of the Black Panther; ruling the tribe in his father’s place. With the help of the Fantastic Four and Wyatt Wingfoot, the Wakandans again repulsed Klaw. During the battle, the Panther fought Klaw face-to-face, eventually overloading his machines and left, believing him defeated. |||| |||| In frustration, Klaw leapt into his own sonic converter in the hopes of giving himself the power to defeat his enemies. It worked and Klaw’s being turned to pure, living sound. Klaw later came after the Fantastic Four, trying to force them to bring him the Panther; but after a fight with the group, Mister Fantastic defeated Klaw when he radioed the Panther who sent him vibranium knuckles to absorb Klaw’s power, which Reed used to beat him into unconsciousness. The Thing then crushed his sonic-gun arm to disable him and they handed him over to the authorities. Klaw was freed from prison by the Crimson Cowl and invited to join the second grouping of the Masters of Evil. The new Masters of Evil eventually fought and captured the Avengers, but then were beaten and Klaw was again imprisoned, only to be set free and returned twice more. |||| |||| Later, while traveling to Wakanda to attempt to steal a device that would strengthen the mental-disintegrating powers of Vibranium, Klaw was defeated by the Thing and the Human Torch, as well as the Black Panther. He was also briefly a member of the Frightful Four, invited by the Wizard. Klaw was defeated and thought destroyed many times afterwards, but every time he managed to rematerialize thanks to his body of living sound."

There, she met Screaming Mimi, and told her about her teammates in the Grapplers. After they escaped from prison, they rejoined Poundcakes' teammates Letha and Titania. The group was then contracted by the Roxxon Oil Company, and given special powers by the Power Broker. Poundcakes was given superhuman strength along with her teammates, but also a pair of 'seismatic boots', which gives her the ability to create tremors and minor earthquakes by stomping the ground. |||| |||| One mission joined the Grapplers with Thundra, a powerful female warrior. They were able to convince her to aid them in sabotaging Project Pegasus, but quickly turned on her and ran off to do their own thing. Poundcakes and Titania were confronted by Giant-Man. He was able to grab Titania, but Poundcakes launched him into a fiery pit of acid. He was able to climb back up, only to be attacked by both women. Poundcakes stomped on his foot, shrinking Giant-Man back down to size. Both Poundcakes and Titania grabbed one of Giant-Man's arms, planning to pull his limbs apart. However, using the last of his strength, Giant-Man grabbed the two mercenaries and smashed them together, knocking them out cold. |||| |||| Poundcakes was next seen with her accomplices in prison. After Dazzler is charged for the death of Klaw, the Grapplers kidnap her and attempt to find out how she killed him. Dazzler refuses to answer anything, which causes Poundcakes to beat her. Dazzler tries to stop the large woman from attacking her, but is unable to do anything. However, as soon as Screaming Mimi uses her powers on Dazzler, she is able to absorb the sound and use it against the Grapplers, defeating them. |||| |||| After breaking out of prison with her teammates, Poundcakes and the Grapplers decided to pay a visit to the Thing, who helped put them in prison after their mission against Project Pegasus. However, as soon as they arrived at the hospital where the Thing was, they were suddenly ambushed by Captain America. Poundcakes immediately attacked the super-hero, but he used his shield to protect him from her assault. He was soon able to defeat her by throwing her with his shield, but she and the other Grapplers quickly recovered. Captain America was soon given back-up by the X-Men, who made quick work of the Grapplers. They were later seen alongside a large army of super-villains, including MODOK, Constrictor, Whiplash, and Mole Man, as they banded together in attempt to kill the Thing. |||| |||| Although her teammates Letha and Titania were soon killed by the Scourge of the Underworld, Poundcakes continued her career in villainy. She was approached by Jackhammer, who showed romantic interest in her. She, however, was not interested, and felt enraged that he would flirt with her in public. Fearing for her reputation, she began creating tremors and attacked Jackhammer. Anaconda, aiding her friend Diamondback on her date with Captain America, attacked Poundcakes and Jackhammer. Asp's paralyzing blasts rendered the pair unconscious, and they drove off, dumping their bodies elsewhere. Poundcakes later received an invitation to join Superia's Femizons, which she accepted.

In the Vertigo series, Madame Xanadu has much of her magical power taken away from her by Merlin. She is shown attempting to get her powers back by various means. Before besting Death and gaining virtual immortality, Madame Xanadu frequently had to drink a potion that rejuvenated her youth. Without it, she would become old and sickly within a matter of weeks.","Nimue Inwudu was the youngest sister of Vivienne (the Lady of the Lake) and Morgana Inwudu. The three grew up as Homo Magi and witnessed the dawn of mankind.  Nimue cared for homo sapiens as she did for all other species, but Morgana liked to toy with them and pull them toward their baser instincts. |||| |||| A bit of Morgana rubbed off on Nimue when she cast a spell of seduction on Merlin, in which she taught him his magic in exchange for sexual favors. Merlin had the last laugh, though, as he succeeded in stripping her magic away from her.  Shortly thereafter, Morgana, now styling herself Morgaine LeFay, conquered Camelot, and Merlin's demon, Etrigan, who was summoned to stop Morgana, was left to wander, as did Nimue, occasionally crossing paths with him. |||| |||| She fled to China and became an adviser in the court of Kublai Khan, trading sexual favors for her passage.

She nearly fell in love with him, but ultimately found him too unfeeling, particularly after he stated that the French Revolution was an important step toward Kent Nelson's recovery of the Doctor Fate helmet and the necessity of the death of Mary Jane Kelly, who was Xanadu's friend (as were the other victims of Jack the Ripper, although she herself had long since abandoned prostitution), on the grounds that Jason Blood (Etrigan) had impregnanted her with a demonic child. |||| |||| Her desire for revenge on the Phantom Stranger over Mary's death inadvertently led to her causing Jim Corrigan to die and become the Spectre. |||| |||| She wandered for quite some time before deciding that she wanted to atone for her sins. She did so by helping those troubled with the supernatural.

He is an expert pilot and a marksman with crossbows, guns and throwing knives. |||| |||| His weaponry includes various firearms, a collapsible crossbow, a wrist spike, spring-loaded stiletto blades in his gauntlets, various explosives and poisoned knives.",,"Young Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on New York's lower east side. After he brutalized fifteen year old Rachel Leighton, two of her brothers assaulted Brock; the eldest brother was killed. Rumlow fled, entering the Taskmaster's school for criminals, and within three years became an instructor there under the name Bingo Brock. As a mercenary, he enlisted with the communist Red Skull (Albert Malik) in Algeria, serving him as 'Frag' until he was sent to invade Arnim Zola's Switzerland chateau. Ultimately the only team member to survive the assault, Rumlow there met and impressed the Nazi Red Skull (Johann Shmidt); this Skull accepted Brock’s services, code-naming him “Crossbones.” |||| |||| Sent to retrieve the five Bloodstone fragments, Crossbones shadowed Helmut Zemo’s search for them. While Zemo battled Captain America, Crossbones knocked out Captain America's pilot, John Jameson, and stole two fragments; when he got near the other three, the five combined to re-animate Heinrich Zemo's corpse under control of the alien Hellfire Helix. Unobserved, Crossbones destroyed the Helix (worn on the corpse's forehead) with a crossbow bolt. Brock then kidnapped Diamondback (whom he recognized as Rachel Leighton), using her as bait to trap Captain America; but when the Skull learned of Crossbones' involvement with the Captain, he ordered Crossbones to flee. Crossbones recruited the Controller and Voice of Doom to serve the Skull, led the Skeleton Crew against the Hellfire Club’s Selene, and, using psychic Tristam Micawber, located the Skull after Magneto kidnapped him. He attempted assassinating the Kingpin, was stopped by Typhoid Mary, and battled Bullseye when the Kingpin retaliated. He led the Skeleton Crew when they were captured by the Schutz-Heiliggruppe (Blitzkrieg, Hauptmann Deutschland, Zeitgeist); after Arnim Zola rescued them, the Skull faked the assassination of himself, Mother Night, and Crossbones. The Red Skull finally fired Crossbones for questioning the Skull's decision to ally with the Viper. |||| Enlarge |||| Crossbones headed east, working briefly in Chicago for druglord Marco Sanzionare against Super Pro. In New York, Crossbones kidnapped and brainwashed Diamondback by abusing her repeatedly and forcing her through a rigid combat training routine. Forcing Diamondback to steal Captain America's super-soldier treated blood from Avengers Mansion, Crossbones returned to the Skull. When the Skeleton Crew's new leader, Cutthroat, plotted Crossbones’ murder, Mother Night warned Brock, who slit Cutthroat's jugular. Diamondback escaped, summoning Captain America and the Falcon to capture the Skull’s operatives; Crossbones was imprisoned, but eventually convinced officials he was rehabilitating, partly by defeating the terrorist cell 'Fortress' when they invaded a Denver hospital. Exploiting his jailors’ gullibility, Crossbones escaped, and was hired by Hydra to bomb New York's embassy row alongside the Absorbing Man, but the pair was stopped by Captain America. Betrayed by Hydra, Crossbones fled, wreaking vengeance on his bosses. He was hired by New Son to assassinate Gambit, but despite allying with Batroc and Zaran, was defeated by the combined efforts of New Orleans' assassin's and thieves’ guilds; Crossbones was imprisoned in the Raft until Electro's break-in freed him. The Skull promptly rehired him, and he was aiding in re-powering a Cosmic Cube when Alexander Lukin’s Winter Soldier assassinated the Red Skull and stole the Cube. Lukin anonymously blamed Captain America for the Skull’s death, but Crossbones soon realized the truth and now appears to be hunting Lukin."

The helmet can also pick up radio transmissions, as well as act as a heads-up display for tracking energy signatures.",,"Chosen at random by the dying Xandarian Rhomann Dey to receive his Nova Corps powers, teenager Richard Rider found himself thrust into the role of superhero, a role he grasped with relish. He battled foes such as Dey's nemesis Zorr, the winged mutant criminal Condor, the amnesiac Powerhouse (actually a Xandarian sent to locate the missing Dey), and the mysterious Sphinx. The latter eventually kidnapped Nova and several others, using Dey's spaceship to transport them all to Xandar. |||| |||| Learning that Xandar was threatened by the Skrull Empire, Nova and his fellows (bar the Sphinx, who had returned to Earth, and Dr. Sun, who teleported to an unknown location) pledged their aid; the Skrulls were eventually driven off with the help of the Galadorian spaceknight Rom. Homesick for Earth, Richard agreed to give up his powers, which were needed to help rebuild war-ravaged Xandar's defenses, and returned home a normal human once more. |||| Enlarge |||| |||| Or so it seemed. Months later Richard was tracked down by Night Thrasher, who believed Richard's powers were merely dormant and wished to recruit Nova for his prospective hero team. To test the theory, Night Thrasher dropped Richard off a roof; luckily for both of them, Night Thrasher was correct, and the adrenaline rush re-awoke Richard's abilities. Alongside several other teenage heroes he founded the New Warriors, and also resumed his solo career. He fought alongside the New Warriors for years, including encounters with Nova's old foe the Sphinx and a brief stint during which the Warriors worked with Cable and X-Force. He was eventually hunted down by Super-Nova, the Xandarian who held the rest of the Nova-Force inside his body and had been driven mad by it. The two of them, aided by the New Warriors and Galactus' Xandarian heralds Firelord and Air-Walker, ended up setting off protocols that led to Xandar's resurrection. The StarCorps was reinstated, and Rider was appointed Centurion Prime and assigned to guard earth's sector of space. |||| |||| Returning to Earth, Rider was confronted with dual lives as Centurion Prime and a member of the New Warriors. He also encountered another Nova from an alternate timeline named Nova 0:0. Nova 0:0 attacked Rider to prepare him for defending his Earth from the force that had destroyed Nova 0:0's Earth, the Deathstorm. After stopping the Deathstorm and saving Earth, Rider was replaced as Centurion Prime for Earth's sector of space by Garthan Saal, the former Super-Nova, after failing to follow orders at a crucial time. |||| |||| When Saal sacrificed himself to save earth from the Dire Wraith queen Volx, he passed his powers back to Rider. He continued to fight alongside the New Warriors until the team broke up, reformed, and broke up again. He agreed to come back as part of the New Warriors reality TV show, and traveled the U.S. with the team, fighting menaces that'd taken up residence in communities that didn't have resident heroes. The team fought several criminals who'd escaped the Raft during the massive prison break that led to the reestablishing of the Avengers, before being recalled to Xandar alongside the rest of the Nova Corps to deal with the threat of the Annihilation Wave. Rider was the only StarCorps member to survive the Wave's surprise attack, and has become the bearer of the entire Nova-Force, as well as the Xandarian Worldmind, the living computers that contain the entire record of Xandarian civilization as well as the minds of all its deceased members. |||| |||| Nova then came into contact with Drax who taught him how to better control the Nova Force and how to kill. Realizing his new leadership abilities, Nova created the United Front, an army opposed to Annihilus. Several beings joined the United Front alongside Nova including Silver Surfer, Ronan, Gamora, Phyla-Vell, Moondragon, the Spaceknights, Blastaar, Stardust, Firelord, Red Shift, Super-Skrull, Star-Lord, and others. Alongside these beings Nova was able to squash Annihilus's forces and kill Annihilus. |||| |||| After the war, Richard started to scan the galaxy, searching for beings who needed help. Continuing this for an undetermined amount of time he became fatigued and homesick. The Worldmind advised Richard to return to Earth to rest. Taking Worldmind's advice Richard returned to Earth to find the state of the world after the Civil War. While back home Richard was approached by Iron Man, who strongly urged Richard to register. Stark then sent Justice to try and convince him to register. Failing to see the point to any of the madness Richard left Earth and returned to his Nova duties. |||| |||| Recently the Phalanx took control of Kree Space and infected many worlds. Finding himself trapped inside Kree Space, Nova crashed into an energy barrier and landed on a Kree outpost severely damaged. There the commander, Ko-Rel took him in and tried to oppose a horde of Phalanx and an infected Gamora. Richard being too weak to fight back, the Worldmind uploaded some of the Nova Force into Ko-Rel turing her into a Nova Corps member. Gamora then slipped past the Kree defenses and infected Richard with the techno-organic virus, turning him into a Phalanx Select. From there Gamora and Rider left the outpost and returned to Hala. |||| |||| Seemingly accepting the transmode virus, Richard alongside Gamora then hunted down and infected Drax with the techno-organic virus. Returning to Hala, Richard was attacked by Ko-Rel who was led by the Worldmind. However, Ko-Rel was not powerful enough to defeat Richard and died at his hands. After returning from the battle, Richard was then taken inside his mind by Worldmind and showed Richard that he was indeed fighting the techno-organic virus. Now boosted with hope and the help of Ko-Rel's returned power, Richard managed to break free of the Phalanx control and escaped from Hala. Richard then created a wormhole and was followed by Drax and Gamora. Once going through the wormhole they were all transported into unknown space. |||| Nova soon found himself at the edge of the universe in a place called Knowhere. Unfortunately, even here there would be no peace for the last of the Nova Centurions as he was attacked by zombies under the control of an unknown evil called Abyss. However, after making an ally in a talking dog named Cosmo, Nova was able to defeat the villain and restore peace to Knowhere. Learning that Nova was transmode positive, Cosmo used the resources at his disposal to chart Nova a course for the birthplace of the Phalanx, Kvch, in hopes that Nova can find a way to cure himself of the virus that is slowly killing him."

(The events of Crisis on Infinite Earths has thrown that interpretation into some doubt.  Indeed, Crisis lent seemingly irresolvable doubt to virtually every Golden Age hero's 'first appearance in the DCU timeline' date.) |||| |||| In our world, though, his date of first publication slightly postdates Superman's, is roughly concurrent with Batman's, and significantly postdates the (newspaper) appearances of The Phantom, Zorro, and several other 'pulpy' predecessors. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he is one of the earliest American comic superheroes--despite, like Batman, having no supernatural powers.  And certainly, in the 2005 DCU, he can safely be said to predate Superman, Batman, and most other superheroes--even if it's rather more tricky to say with authority that he's the 'original' superhero of the DCU.  (Events of the 2005/6 Infinite Crisis may shake up the DCU's past once again, though, giving us clearer answers in the near future.) |||| |||| More apt to solve mysteries than perform super heroic feats, Dodds is usually accompanied by his love interest (and sometimes sidekick) Dian Belmont, as well as his usual sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy. |||| |||| Dodds uses the visions received in dreams to solve mysteries."

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Titan was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne from her sister Lilandra, Titan was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne.

200,Warbird (Marvel)(01 - Carol Danvers),Carol Susan Jane Danvers. ,200_20070119222449_char.jpg,"Warbird's powers included flight, enhanced strength, durability and the ability to shoot concussive energy bursts from her hands.",,"Carol Danvers entered the Air Force upon graduating from high school to pursue her love of aircraft and her dreams of flying. Carol was a top student at the Air Force Academy and enjoyed a rapid career advancement rising to the rank of Major. Because of her stellar performance, superb combat skills and natural intellect, Carol was recruited into the intelligence field. She ended up serving with the C.I.A., during which time she met and worked with Colonel Nick Fury. She was partnered with Colonel Michael Rossi and the two became lovers. Carol had a distinguished career in the C.I.A. |||| |||| While on special assignment with Nick Fury, Carol met the Canadian agent called Logan. The two were eventually paired up and shared a number of adventures together. During one of their infamous escapades, they clashed with the brutal Sabretooth who was working for the Hellfire Club. During their time together, Logan and Carol became close friends, perhaps even lovers. Both have saved each other's lives numerous times. |||| |||| When Carol was captured by the KGB and imprisoned at Lubyanka prison, Logan was among those who defied orders to save her. Following her affiliation with the C.I.A., Carol took a position with N.A.S.A. as the security director for Cape Canaveral. It was in this capacity that Carol first met Captain Marvel, the Kree warrior, Mar-Vell. In her official capacity, Carol was challenged with unraveling the mystery of this alien soldier. During her investigation, the two forged a unique bond, first as friends and then as lovers. It was this relationship that would change Carol forever. |||| |||| Captain Marvel's mortal enemy, Colonel Yon-Rogg kidnapped Carol, using her as bait in his conflict with Mar-vell. In the course of the battle, Carol and Mar-vell were caught in the explosion of a Kree Psyche-Magneton device. The energy bombardment somehow caused Carol�s genetic structure to be melded with Mar-vell's. While Mar-vell was apparently unaltered by the event, Carol was now a perfect hybrid of Kree and human genes. In addition, she possessed all of Mar-vell's Kree knowledge and training. Through this transformation, Ms. Marvel was born. |||| |||| Because of her failure to capture Captain Marvel, Carol lost her job at N.A.S.A. She recovered quickly, writing a successful novel about her experience in the space industry. This lead to her landing a position as the editor of WOMAN magazine, a subsidiary of the Daily Bugle. Carol's viewpoints as a staunch feminist created tensions with her boss J. Jonah Jameson, but made her the perfect choice to be Woman Magazine's editor. |||| |||| Just as Carol was beginning this new chapter of her life, the powers and persona of Ms. Marvel began to emerge. At first, Carol experienced blackouts triggered by Ms. Marvel's precognitive seventh sense and the two persona were very distinct, both mentally and physically. As time went on and Carol came to accept her new role as Ms. Marvel, the two personalities merged. A second exposure to the energies of a Kree Psyche-Magnetron also imbued Ms. Marvel with some of the properties which formally resided in her Kree uniform (namely flight and the ability to change into costume at will). |||| |||| Carol fought many villains during her career as Ms. Marvel, including Deathbird, MODOK, A.I.M., the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Hellfire Club, and Mystique. She also joined the Avengers for a brief period, and it was this affiliation which drew Carol to the attention of Marcus. The son of Immortus, Marcus observed the Avengers from afar and became obsessed with Ms. Marvel. Marcus kidnapped Carol using Immortus' technology to manipulate her mind and seduce her into loving him. Marcus impregnated Carol with a child who would rapidly grow up into Marcus himself, enabling him to escape Limbo. He returned Carol to the Avengers, unaware of her time and seduction in Limbo. Carol was shocked when she learned that she was pregnant and devastated since she was completely unaware of the identity of the father. The pregnancy ran its course in a matter of days, leaving Carol shaken - both as a woman and a hero. The child grew within a day into a full-grown man, one who was determined to win his 'mother's' love. Carol, still bewildered by the entire experience, agreed to accompany Marcus back to Limbo. The Avengers wished the pair well. In Limbo, Marcus continued to age rapidly and quickly died of old age, leaving Carol alone in Limbo and free of his mind control. Carol was sickened by Marcus' manipulations and felt betrayed by the Avengers who failed to question Marcus` actions or motives. |||| |||| Carol mastered Immortus' technology and returned to Earth, choosing to settle in San Francisco instead of returning to the Avengers. Carol's return to Earth was sensed by the precognitive Destiny. Destiny had previously prophesied that Ms. Marvel would be involved in an event that would destroy the life of Mystique's foster daughter, Rogue. Mystique had vowed to destroy Ms. Marvel before this could happen and developed an obsessive hatred for Ms. Marvel. Rogue, overhearing Destiny's concerns and Mystique's ranting, decided to take the battle to Carol herself. Rogue attacked Carol in San Francisco and the pair fought atop the Golden Gate Bridge. When Rogue tried to use her power-absorbing abilities on Carol, something went terribly wrong, and she absorbed too much of Carol's persona, making the transferal permanent. Driven mad by Carol's thoughts and memories, Rogue threw Carol's body from the bridge. Amazingly, Carol was rescued by Spider-Woman. At the hospital, Carol was identified and diagnosed as a blank slate. Jessica Drew called in Professor Xavier of the X-Men, who was able to pull forth Carol's memories and personality from her subconscious. However, he was unable to restore her emotional connection to those memories and experiences. Carol and Jessica spent some time at the X-Mansion while Carol recovered from her ordeal. |||| |||| During this time, a now-powerless Carol confronted the Avengers and vented her anger for their betrayal of her. Carol remained with the X-Men for a brief time, during which she often accompanied them on missions. One such mission led to Carol's capture by the alien Brood. Fascinated by her Kree/Human physiology, the Brood performed experiments on Carol's genetic structure. This unleashed the full potential of Carol�s Kree/Human physiology transforming her into the cosmic-powered Binary. Carol now possessed more power than ever due to her link to a white hole. |||| |||| Carol returned with the X-Men and was strongly considering joining them on a permanent basis when the desperately troubled Rogue came to Xavier for help. Upon seeing Rogue, Carol flew into a rage and punched her into orbit. The X-Men reluctantly informed Carol that Xavier had allowed Rogue to join the X-Men. Unable to accept this, Carol opted to join the space pirates known as the Starjammers and to leave her troubles on Earth behind. As Binary, Carol was a valued member of the Starjammers and fought alongside them to restore Lilandra to the Shi'ar throne. In space, Carol was able to escape her loss and rebuild her life. The stars were her escape and offered her a whole universe in which to escape the emptiness her former life represented. Carol remained with the Starjammers for a number of years. During this time, she lived out her lifelong dream of exploring the stars. She formed a close friendship with Raza Longknife, the sullen cyborg member of the Starjammers. Despite fighting the Shi'ar forces and her former enemy Deathbird, Carol found herself frustrated at the lack of challenge among the Starjammers' adversaries. When Earth's sun was threatened, Carol chose to abandon her mission for the Shi'ar Majestrix Lilandra Neramani and aid the Avenger Quasar in saving it. This effort left Carol in a depleted state, and she spent months recuperating at the Avengers Mansion. During this time, she reconciled with the Avengers. When the Starjammers came to Earth and into conflict with the Avengers, Carol helped resolve the conflict and decided to try and rebuild her life on Earth. |||| |||| Recently, Carol rechristened herself Warbird and rejoined the Avengers, following a reality-warping conflict with Morgan Le Fay. She brought with her a whole new set of problems. First, her powers were slowly depleting, and she attempted to hide this fact from the Avengers, leading to a conflict with Captain America. Carol had also developed a drinking problem, which was immediately noticed by recovering alcoholic and fellow Avenger, Iron Man. Her drinking, coupled with her determination to prove herself a worthy addition to the Avengers and her secretiveness about her power loss, led to reckless grand-standing and sloppy teamwork. This eventually endangered the lives of her teammates and led to a formal court-martial before her fellow Avengers. Rather than face her problems and a forced demotion to reserve status, Carol quit the team. This all occurred amidst the Avengers' conflict with a rebel faction of Kree. Seeking to join the battle despite leaving the team, Carol realized that she no longer had the capability to reach escape velocity in order to join the battle on the Moon between the Avengers and the Kree Lunatic Legion. |||| |||| Disheartened, Carol realized that she'd hit rock bottom, and moved to Seattle to work on rebuilding her career as a freelance writer and novelist. She started to make some progress in accepting her alcoholism but refused to accept that she had a serious problem for months. After her drinking almost led to disaster in a number of combat situations, Carol was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. Carol's doctor warned that she had done considerable damage to her internal organs and that another drink might kill her. This diagnosis combined with the knowledge that she had nearly killed a plane full of people during a drunken rage have forced Carol to admit the severity of her drinking problem. Carol has now accepted that she is an alcoholic and has started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis. She has since been accepted into the ranks of the Avengers and taken the name Ms. Marvel once again. |||| |||| When the Scarlet Witch warped reality, Carol was one of the few people who remembered the events when reality was restored, and she determined to prove her worth as a true hero, something she had experienced during the events. She told this to Captain America when he offered her membership in the new Avengers team, but she declined, feeling unready to join that august assemblage. Cap assured her that a place would always be available to her in the Avengers."

On an out-of-service rail-track an odd and driverless subway car stopped to pick-up Billy and his companion.

As the smoke clears Billy notices the wall behind the wizard is inscribed with the names of six great elders which together form the name SHAZAM: Solomon- wisdom, Hercules - strength, Atlas - stamina, Zeus - power, Achilles - Courage, and Mercury - speed. Shazam relates to the young boy that he needs a new champion to battle evil and that he has chosen Billy. 'Speak my name' shouts Shazam! |||| |||| As Billy shouts the name of the ancient wizard, lightning drops from the ceiling of the chamber striking him, while at the same time a deafening peal of thunder echoes off the cavern walls.

Learning of Moonstone (Lloyd Bloch), she became his psychologist and manipulated him into rejecting his moonstone, which she then absorbed to gain the powers of Moonstone. |||| |||| |||| Karla worked briefly for the Corporation, controlling the Hulk and manipulating General Thunderbolt Ross into a nervous breakdown. She continued to pursue greater power, stealing Curt Connors' Enervator and searching the moon's surface for further moonstone fragments. First Egghead and then Baron (Helmut) Zemo recruited Moonstone for their Masters of Evil, and she aided each against the Avengers. After the last of these fights, she decided to serve out her prison term and give up her criminal life. However, when Zemo formed a group of villains to masquerade as heroes, he broke Moonstone out of the Vault and she returned to villainy as the Thunderbolt Meteorite. After their ruse was exposed, she remained with the Thunderbolts as they tried to reform, becoming romantically involved with Hawkeye. |||| |||| |||| Karla's road to redemption was less than smooth. She executed the Kosmosian Primotur, and appeared to betray the Thunderbolts to both the new Masters of Evil and Graviton before rejoining the team. When the Thunderbolts were trapped on Counter-Earth, Karla removed a second moonstone from that world's Lloyd Bloch (known there as the Phantom Eagle), dramatically increasing her own powers. When the Avengers later interfered in the Thunderbolts' plan to control the world's 'transnormal energy,' a failsafe Karla had planted against Zemo was triggered and the stolen energy was funnelled into her moonstones. Karla attempted to use this energy to flee, but the Thunderbolts and Avengers combined forces to stop her. In the end, Zemo ended up in possession of both moonstones and Karla was left comatose. |||| |||| Currently, Zemo is in control of Karla, forcing her to act as a puppet (in such acts as attacking the Thunderbolts).  It is unclear whether she is aware of these acts or still comatose..."

Like Thundra, he came from the 23rd century; although in Thundra's future, women enslaved the men, in Mahkizmo's timeline the men subjugated the women. Thundra had gone to the 20th century of Earth-616 to prevent the existence of Machus by altering the past, and Machus was sent to stop her. He fought and defeated the Fantastic Four and teleported Thundra back to Machus. There, he used an energy beam to imprison her and sap her will. The Fantastic Four followed them using Doctor Doom's time machine, but Mahkizmo and the men of Machus defeated the heroes and claimed Medusa (who was a member of the Fantastic Four at the time) as his prize. Medusa entranced Mahkizmo, and knocked him out by hitting in the head with a jug of wine to escape. Mahkizmo sentenced Thundra and the Fantastic Four to death in the gladiatorial arena, fighting them himself when they defeated his champions. As Mahkizmo defeated them all, Medusa arrived with Thundra's Femizons, who fought the Machans. Mahkizmo summoned the energy for his devastating nuclear-punch, but Thundra and the Thing punched him at the same time and caused an energy implosion, destroying Mahkizmo. This caused the last barriers between the two Earths of Machus and Femizonia to dissolve and the two worlds merged. |||| |||| Mahkizmo survived the implosion as an intangible, invisible cloud of atoms. He was furious that the men and women of the now-joined world were able to live in harmony. He took over one of the new world's men and transformed it into his own. He traveled back to the 20th century and planned to kill all of the women in the past to prevent the worlds from merging. He attacked the She-Hulk, until Cupid shot him with an arrow that caused him to fall in love with the She-Hulk. He took her back to his world to make her his bride, but the Thing and Wyatt Wingfoot followed them. The She-Hulk and the Thing combined their power and defeated Mahkizmo. |||| |||| Mahkizmo was one of the Fantastic Four's enemies that attended a gathering by the Puppet Master in an effort to combine forces. The Fantastic Four captured Mahkizmo and transferred him to the newly constructed Vault in the Negative Zone.

During an experiment, however, an alien monster was unleashed and Dr. van Dyne was killed. Her father's associate, Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym, had created a substance called 'Pym particles', which allowed the user to grow or shrink in size, and had become the superhero Ant-Man; when Janet's father died, she convinced Pym to help her, and he gave her a supply of 'Pym particles' and subjected her to a procedure which granted her the ability to, upon shrinking, grow wings and fire blasts of energy, which she called her 'wasp's stings'. As Ant-Man and The Wasp, they defeated the monster and sent it to its own dimension, and had several more adventures together. |||| |||| Soon afterward, the superhero team, which Janet herself dubbed the Avengers, formed, and the pair were among its founding members. Although they took occasional leaves of absence, the two have almost always remained members; during the course, Janet grew as a person and several years later would be elected leader of the team. |||| |||| The relationship between Janet and Pym had always been one of loving squabbling, but her wealth and his research had always stopped him from proposing. One day a cocky new costumed crime fighter called Yellowjacket broke into Avengers HQ. He claimed to have disposed of Pym and even kidnapped Janet. To the outrage of her colleagues, Janet then married Yellowjacket. A tension-filled wedding was made even more edgy by an attack by the Circus of Crime. During the fight it was discovered that Yellowjacket was Pym. He had had an accident with some chemicals causing him a severe case of Schizophrenia. Janet had realized this from very early on and had taken advantage to finally tie the knot. |||| |||| However, her relationship with Pym became rocky, as he suffered a further series of mental problems. A few years later, Pym had a complete breakdown, and became completely paranoid. During the course of this breakdown, he became overbearing and verbally abusive. At the nadir of his degeneration, he struck Janet, and then proceeded to concoct a plan to make himself look good in front of his teammates by staging an attack upon them which only he could stop. This plan backfired and Pym was exposed, disgraced, and expelled from the Avengers, and the couple divorced. She remained with the team despite these hardships, and after Pym's mental state returned to normal, the two became friends again and, some years later, resumed a romantic relationship. |||| |||| During the Disassembling of the Avengers by Scarlet Witch, she was knocked into a coma by an attack on Avengers Mansion.

1813,Kang (Marvel),Nathaniel Richards (Kang) ,1813_20060329073117_char.jpg,"Kang ages at a slightly slower rate than modern humanity. |||| |||| Kang typically carries various weapons, such as an anti-matter defense screen generator, a 'vibration-ray' projector, an electromagnetic field-amplifier, neutrino-ray warheaded missile launcher (hand-gun size), electrical paralysis generator, nerve gas sprayer, and a molecular expander. Kang commands a vast armada of warriors from across the galaxy of his future era. He uses numerous robots, most notably his Growing-Man stimuloids, packed with the 'Growth Pollen' of the world Kosmos, which causes them to grow in size and strength by absorbing kinetic energy. |||| |||| Kang's primary base in 40th-century Other Earth is the Center, but he also maintains a secret dwelling in the realm known only as Purgatory, as well as strongholds in various alternate realties. His former base Chronopolis, powered by the Heart of Forever, served as a crossroads into virtually every era in human history, but lay just out of phase with the timestream and was therefore undetectable. Its palace and inhabitants were unaffected by temporal divergence or the passage of time. Kang formerly employed a 20' long space-worthy vehicle housing his time machine, which could reach all eras of all timelines by accessing the transtemporal realm of Limbo. Kang has used a number of other vessels, such as his Sphinx ship and Damocles Base, an immense sword-shaped orbiting headquarters.",,"Nathaniel Richards was born in the calendar year 3000 of the alternate timeline Other Earth (a.k.a. Earth-6311). Bullied as a youth, his throat was slit by a bully, Morgan, and he was hospitalized for a year. Recovering, he studied science and his ancestor's history tapes of the heroic age of Earth-616 (mainstream Earth), growing into a man of adventure in a time of complacency. At age 25 he discovered his ancestor's fortress and time machine. Following encounters with alternate Earth Fantastic Fours seeking to thwart his future self, which faded from his mind, Richards constructed an immense sphinx-shaped ship and traveled to Egypt circa 2950 BC. The ship crashed, blinding and stranding him there, but he subjugated the natives with his technology. He forced the natives to procure for him a radioactive herb which would restore his sight, then, as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, he ruled as a god for a decade, during which he encountered Samira, Mistress of the Nile, who became his enemy; Amenhotep, whom he transformed into a vampiric creature; and time-travelers such as Killpower and the Genetix team. At some point he had a son, Ramades, by a slave. Eventually, a struggle with the Fantastic Four, which also involved the young En Sabah Nur (later Apocalypse), the moon god Khonshu, and modern-era heroes Dr. Strange and the Avengers, forced Rama to flee that time period. |||| |||| En route to the future, a 'time storm' diverted Rama to the modern era and an encounter with a space-lost Dr. Doom. Damaged by the time storm, Rama-Tut's control module skipped several years into the future and briefly crashed in Egypt, where he fought fellow time-travelers Blaquesmith and Cable. Inspired by Doom, he took the armored identity of the Scarlet Centurion, traveled to another timeline (Earth-689) and duped its Avengers into neutralizing all their fellow heroes so he could rule; but he was defeated by the visiting Avengers of Earth-616 and cast outside time. |||| |||| Richards sought to return to his native time, but temporal disruptions hurled him into Other Earth's 40th century. As Kang, he conquered that entire world, sparing only the tiny kingdom of Carelius due to his interest in the king's daughter, Ravonna. Kang's life became progressively non-linear, as each foray in time produced at least one divergent-timestream counterpart; it is extremely difficult to identify which Kang counterpart was involved with each encounter. Conquering everything within 100 light years, Kang next attacked his ancestor's world in the modern age of marvels, but the Avengers forced him to flee. Seeking a new power base, Kang established himself in 1901 AD as Victor Timely, a brilliant inventor and industrialist who founded the city of Timely, Wisconsin, became its first mayor, and transformed it into a technological marvel over the next century; 'Victor' appeared to age and be replaced by his children (Kang in new guises). The city also housed a portal to his base Chronopolis where he gathered warriors from various eras to serve as his strike force, the Anachronauts. Kang's continued efforts saw his Spider-Man robot (Timespinner) destroyed by the Avengers and Spider-Man, and his conquest of Camelot foiled by the time-traveling Thing and Human Torch. He also assaulted the Reed and Sue Richards wedding, unknowingly drawn there by Dr. Doom's Emotion-Charger device. |||| |||| Returning to the 40th century, Kang completed his galactic conquest and even invaded other dimensions. In Kosmos, he gained technology to create his powerful Growing Men. Kang then brought the Avengers forward in time, intending to subjugate them or defeat them in front of Ravonna. When both the Avengers and Ravonna defied him, the furious Kang easily conquered her small kingdom; however, when he tried to force Ravonna to marry him, he caused unrest in his troops for failing to follow his own edict of slaying all conquered rulers. Kang's troops, led by General Baltag, turned on him, but he allied with the Avengers to defeat them. Impressed that Kang had risked his life for her, Ravonna leapt in the path of a blast from the defeated Baltag, saving Kang, but apparently dying in his place. The devastated Kang sought to restore Ravonna. Later, the cosmic Grandmaster challenged him to a contest of champions, offering him the power of life or death as the prize. Using the Avengers as pawns, Kang was victorious, but he chose the power of death, intending to slay the Avengers. Foiled by the Black Knight, Kang had to live with the knowledge that he had squandered his chance to save Ravonna. Disturbed at having lost and feeling sympathy for Ravonna, the Grandmaster removed Ravonna from stasis, revived her, and told her of Kang's betrayal. Moving on, Kang tried to use the Hulk to destroy Bruce Banner's ancestor to prevent the Avengers from ever forming, but the Hulk foiled this plot. Kang then sent a robot double of himself to capture the Avengers during a war with rival time lord Zarrko the Tomorrow Man. |||| |||| One of Kang's most relentless campaigns was his quest for the Celestial Madonna, a woman fated to give birth to the most powerful being in the universe. Wanting to be that being's father, Kang narrowed the Madonna's identity to Agatha Harkness, Mantis, and the Scarlet Witch, abducting all three. Rama-Tut, actually Kang's own future self, arrived to help the Avengers thwart his plot. Mantis was finally revealed as the Madonna, and when Kang could not claim her, he tried to kill her; but his fatal blast was intercepted by the Swordsman, who died instead. Kang and Rama-Tut were then pulled into Limbo by Immortus, a potential future self of both men, but Kang imprisoned Immortus and used his technology to create the Legion of the Unliving, a team of reportedly deceased pawns drawn from past eras. The Avengers defeated the Legion and Kang fled. Kang soon returned, allied with a trio of Kangs from different time periods, and tried to abduct Mantis at her wedding, but Immortus foiled him by substituting a Space Phantom as his captive. |||| |||| Kang next made a base in Tombstone, Arizona, circa 1873 AD, intending to use it as a stepping stone to conquer the modern age. Opposed by cowboy heroes, as well as time-traveling Avengers, Kang disintegrated when his force field shorted out in battle with Thor. However, a failsafe device transported Kang's consciousness to an alternate body, as it had during many other near-death experiences. Though taking place in rapid succession in the modern era, these last two campaigns accounted for ten years of Kang's life. Less time-intensive efforts included seeking the reality-altering power of a Cosmic Cube, facilitating an attempt by the Inuit (Eskimo) Aningan Kenojuak to reclaim Captain America as the 'God in the Ice' worshipped by his people years ago, conquering an alternate 40th-century Earth, battling the legendary First Line, and participating in the hero vs. villain war on the virtually omnipotent Beyonder's Battleworld. |||| |||| Kang then found his 40th-century base ravaged by rebels loyal to Baltag. To recover his base, he sought out a Growing Man stored in the modern era and battled Thor, who banished him to Limbo. There Kang chanced across Immortus' stronghold, Tenebrae, and learned of his own multitude of divergent counterparts. Unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, Kang formed the Council of Kangs, choosing a few of his most capable counterparts as allies, and began eliminating redundant Kangs from each alternate reality. One of these sought to pair with an alternate Ravonna and wipe out all other realities, but was eliminated after accidentally killing his lover. Kang prepared robot duplicates to replace the slain counterparts to rule the empires of every Kang in existence. At the same time, Kang re-took his 40th-century base via his Growing Man. After the rest of the counterparts were eliminated, the prime Kang slew the rest of the Council. |||| |||| Immortus then appeared, explained that he was Kang's future self, and showed Kang a psyche-globe containing the memories of all of the slain divergent Kangs. Kang tore the globe from his hands, only to go mad as the minds of all of the other Kangs merged with his. The last Kang-now every Kang, since he possessed all of his counterparts' memories-fled into Limbo. To save himself, Kang used his helmet's temporal circuitry to create an additional divergence/counterpart, dividing his madness between two Kangs. One made his way to Chronopolis to recuperate, while the other, still addled, was recruited by the Cross-Time Kangs, a group of beings who had defeated or slain alternate Kangs and usurped the Kang identity. That Kang learned of a plot by Kang-Nebula (actually a power-hungry Ravonna) to obtain the 'ultimate weapon' within the Time Bubble, a period of time in Earth-8810 surrounded by an impassable temporal barrier. A trio of Kangs followed Kang-Nebula into the Time Bubble where they were cast into the vortex surrounding it and ultimately destroyed, though the divergent Kang also sent his Growing Man to help foil the demonic Inferno invasion of Earth. |||| |||| Taking control of Chronopolis, the prime Kang sought revenge on Mantis in the modern era, joined Dr. Doom during the Infinity War, took over the Cross-Time Kangs, learned an assassin was stalking him, and exposed his would-be killer as Ravonna, now calling herself the Terminatrix. Intrigued by her warrior nature, Kang battled her, but sacrificed himself to save her from an assault by the Avengers. Overcoming her hatred for Kang, Ravonna impersonated him and took over the Cross-Time Kangs. When Chronopolis was attacked by the immensely powerful temporal entity Alioth, Ravonna revived Kang, and with the aid of the Avengers they sacrificed the Cross-Time Kangs, using their energy to imprison Alioth. |||| |||| The reunited Kang and Ravonna (who posed as Victor Timely's fiancée Rebecca Tourmenet for a time) soon ruled Chronopolis side by side. However, Kang, now almost sixty, grew weary of administrative matters. Missing the days when he was worshipped in a small land, Kang returned to ancient Egypt circa 2930 BC as Rama-Tut and smashed his chrono-sphere. As Rama-Tut, he spent ten years benevolently enjoying his people's adulation. In 2920 BC he encountered the Avengers, who had been trapped in the past by a time machine that could only travel backwards in time. Determined not to become Immortus (whose subtle manipulations he despised), the later Rama-Tut tried to break the cycle by placing himself in suspended animation, reviving in the modern era to battle his past Kang self during the Celestial Madonna struggle. Failing to change the course of events and feeling resigned to his fate, Rama headed for Limbo, but upon glimpsing a chrono-flash of Immortus bowing to the powerful Time-Keepers, he was infuriated by the idea of becoming anyone's lap-dog, and vowed to overcome his destiny. Rama-Tut returned to Chronopolis, resumed his Kang identity and used his rivals to destroy each other. He then destroyed the mind-transfer failsafe device he had so often used to cheat death, feeling that it took the risk-and thus the enjoyment-out of conflict. After a brief battle with the X-Men and an enterprising starship crew, Kang formed an alliance with Libra (Gustav Brandt), the Kree Supreme Intelligence and the Avengers against Immortus and the Time-Keepers. Ravonna and the Anachronauts were apparently slain and Chronopolis was destroyed, but Kang managed to destroy the Time-Keepers and forcibly diverge himself from Immortus, leaving his future uncharted. |||| |||| Renewed by this victory, Kang engineered a series of successors, each of whom he named Marcus. These infants were sent back in time and trained to be warriors worthy of inheriting Kang's empire. Following a failed effort to conquer the realm Otherworld, Kang, alongside Marcus XXIII (outfitted as the Scarlet Centurion), used Damocles Base, his massive armada, and alliances with various criminal forces (including rogue Atlanteans and Deviants) to conquer Earth; but the Avengers led a rebellion that ultimately defeated and imprisoned Kang. Marcus freed Kang in hopes of restoring their dominion, but Kang knew that Marcus had held back during the war more than once because of his attraction to Avengers member Warbird. Unable to forgive this betrayal, Kang slew Marcus. Disheartened, Kang told his computer to postpone development of Marcus XXIV. Regaining his focus, Kang plotted against Iron Lad, his younger self created by his meddling in his own past, and his allies in the Young Avengers. |||| Note: Differences between the history of Other-Earth and Earth-616, as well as differing calendars in different realms, and damage to records during periods of massive warfare, have led to some inconsistency in the dating of the time periods of both Kang and Ravonna."
732,Moon Knight (Marvel),Marc Spector ,732_20050928144752_char.jpg,"Moon Knight gains enhanced strength, endurance, and reflexes at night, reaching his pinnacle during a full moon, and sometimes has prophetic visions. |||| |||| Moon Knight usually carries a truncheon which can be modified into nunchuks, and silver darts shaped like crescent moons. While serving the Committee, Moon Knight wore a silver cestus on each arm, studded with spikes. While he served the Priests of Khonshu, Moon Knight wielded an ankh which he used as a club, an ax, a boomerang, throwing irons, and bolas. Most of these Egyptian weapons had actually been designed and built for the priests by the time-displaced Hawkeye. Later, Moon Knight wore protective Adamantium armor and wielded an Adamantium staff, a truncheon which could fire a cable line, and gauntlets which could fire his crescent darts. As Marc Spector he wielded various firearms, and would occasionally employ them in his Moon Knight identity as well.",,"Marc Spector was the son of a rabbi whose family had fled Europe in the 1930s to escape the Holocaust. As Marc matured, he rejected his father's morality and embraced materialism. He became a heavyweight boxer, then a U.S. Marine, and then a CIA operative. At the CIA, Marc worked with William Cross, who betrayed the agency, later becoming the villain Crossfire. Marc's brother Randall joined him in the CIA but he also betrayed the agency, selling weapons to both sides in an altercation in Italy. When Marc's lover Lisa overheard Randall's plans, he killed her with a meat cleaver. Marc hunted Randall down, inflicting injuries that left Randall psychotic. Marc befriended fellow CIA agent Amos Lardner, but unknowingly turned him over to Operation: Cobra, a CIA project designed to control its agents' minds. Fed up with the CIA, Marc became a mercenary and spent several years as a hired gun. Although he ostensibly sought to fight for causes he believed in, Marc was easily persuaded to fight for anyone who paid him enough. While working in Africa, Marc met the French mercenary Jean-Paul DuChamp, whom he nicknamed 'Frenchie'. Marc and Frenchie became close friends, and served together on several missions. |||| |||| |||| On one assignment, Marc helped overthrow the government of Bosqueverde, a South American country, and assassinated its president, Ricardo Dominguez. Rodrigo Raposa took over the country, having promised Marc he would install a new democracy, but he actually established a fierce dictatorship. Marc and Frenchie eventually fell in with Raoul Bushman, a bloodthirsty terrorist. Bothered by Bushman's savagery and by his own stirrings of conscience, Marc began to question his mercenary lifestyle. During a mission to the Sudan, Marc saw Bushman assault the town of Selima, seeking information on archaeologist Dr. Peter Alraune's discovery of an Egyptian pharaoh's tomb which might contain gold. Dr. Alraune attempted to stab Bushman from behind, but Marc warned him in time, and Bushman slew Dr. Alraune by biting him in the neck with his steel teeth. |||| |||| Disgusted, Marc helped Dr. Alraune's daughter Marlene escape Selima, but Bushman caught Spector in the act. After Bushman executed the people of the town, Spector attacked him, only to be defeated by Bushman, who deposited the unconscious Spector in the desert and left him to die. Spector dragged himself through the sands to the tomb unearthed by Dr. Alraune and was found by Marlene and her servants. They brought him into the tomb, placing his body at the foot of a statue of the moon god, Khonshu. Marc was pronounced dead, but as Marlene wept over his body, he suddenly arose, alive. Spector believed that Khonshu had restored him to life to serve as the moon's knight of vengeance. Donning a cloak taken from Khonshu's statue, Spector destroyed Bushman's forces in Selima, but Bushman escaped when Marc was distracted by Marlene, who had followed him back to the town. Frenchie arrived to help them, and Spector collapsed into Marlene's arms, exhausted. |||| |||| Aided by Marlene and Frenchie, Spector honed his abilities to wage war on crime. Using his mercenary profits, Marc created the identity of New York millionaire Steven Grant to help him mingle with influential people. He also created the identity of Manhattan cab driver Jake Lockley to make contacts with people on the streets. As Lockley, he befriended the homeless Bertrand Crawley, his main street contact, and Gena Landers, a coffee shop owner whose sons Ricky and Ray helped perform investigative work for him. Marc eventually shared his secrets with Crawley and the Landers family. Marlene, now Marc's lover, came to regard him as Steven Grant, and he suppressed his life as Spector. Although his multiple identities threatened Marc's sanity, Marlene helped ground his psyche. She also designed the Moon Knight costume for him, while Frenchie designed the first Mooncopter, serving as Moon Knight's pilot. Marc brought the statue of Khonshu back to New York, still believing in the moon god's power. |||| |||| While Moon Knight was still establishing his reputation, Frenchie infiltrated the criminal financiers known as the Committee and learned of their plans to capture the Werewolf Jack Russell. Frenchie offered Moon Knight's services to the Committee, claiming that Moon Knight was his employee. The Committee approved, and Moon Knight fought the Werewolf, defeating him when the sun rose and he became Jack Russell again. Moon Knight brought Russell, his lover Topaz, and his sister Lissa to the Committee, who revealed that they intended to use the Werewolf to kill their enemies, and hoped that Lissa would become a werewolf as well. A disgusted Moon Knight set the Werewolf free, rescued Topaz and Lissa, and helped the Werewolf defeat the Committee. Moon Knight moved on to other cases, thwarting the political manipulator Conquer-Lord, who used elaborate death traps in a plot to assassinate the mayor of New York City for the criminal Corporation; aiding the Defenders against the android Zodiac; battling the Masked Marauder's Maggia alongside Spider-Man; defeating the hirsute terrorist Lupinar; and aiding the Thing against Crossfire. |||| |||| Moon Knight faced his brother again when Randall went on a killing spree in New York, slaughtering nurses with a hatchet. Marlene bravely posed as a nurse to draw him out for Marc, and Randall nearly killed her. Moon Knight stalked Randall, who was seemingly impaled upon a broken tree, but Randall had actually left an imposter to take his place. Marc eventually learned that his friend Amos Lardner had died trying to escape from the CIA's Operation: Cobra. While investigating, Spector was attacked by Amos's brother James, whom the project had brainwashed into becoming 'Cobra'. Moon Knight was able to short-circuit the technology controlling Lardner, who then turned on his controllers, killing them along with himself. |||| |||| Moon Knight faced other menaces such as the Slasher, a man slaying homeless people in an effort to find his father (who turned out to be Crawley); the Midnight Man, an art thief; Morpheus, a man able to control people through their dreams; Stained Glass Scarlet, a nun who became a vigilante after being forced to kill her criminal son; Daredevil's enemy the Jester; Arsenal (Nimrod Strange) and his Third World Slayers; and the satanic cult the Left Hand Path and its leader, Morning Star, whose goals led to another encounter with the Werewolf. Bushman returned to torment Spector by capturing the statue of Khonshu and destroying it. With the statue gone, Spector went insane, believing he needed Khonshu's guidance. When Marlene told him she had hidden the original statue and that Bushman had only destroyed a copy, Spector regained his sanity and defeated Bushman. It was only afterward that he thought to ask Marlene if she had told him the truth, but she observed that either way, it didn't matter. |||| |||| Moon Knight suffered another internal crisis when he faced Carson Knowles, a candidate for mayor who used the identity of Black Spectre to forcibly coerce people of influence in New York to support his campaign. Knowles had been inspired by Moon Knight to don his costume, noting how Moon Knight was feared by others because of his mask. In his first encounter with the Black Spectre, Moon Knight unmasked him, but was subsequently unable to prove that Knowles was the Black Spectre. As even Marlene began to doubt him, Moon Knight's sanity began to fray, until he turned again to the statue for guidance; he was able to draw the Black Spectre into another fight and unmask him on television, vindicating himself. |||| |||| After his father's death, Spector was outraged when his body was stolen by Reuben Davis, a former student of Elias Spector who had mastered Kaballah. Using the body as a power source, Davis took the name Zohar and used his magical power to punish Marc Spector for his sins. Moon Knight defeated Zohar, but Spector subsequently suffered another serious mental breakdown and decided to abandon all of his alternate identities to settle down with Marlene; however, he was contacted by three ancient Egyptian Priests who had served Khonshu for thousands of years, and they convinced him that he was truly the avatar of Khonshu. The priests guided Moon Knight into new adventures, his strength becoming superhuman during the full moon. Marlene, no longer willing to accept Marc as Moon Knight, left him. When members of the West Coast Avengers were stranded in ancient Egypt via time-travel, their leader Hawkeye formed an alliance with Khonshu, who contacted Moon Knight in the present to assist them. Moon Knight teamed with Henry Pym and Espirita to rescue the Avengers, and the assembled heroes defeated the alien entity Dominus, who had stranded the Avengers in the first place. |||| |||| Moon Knight stayed with the Avengers for awhile, and was gradually accepted into their ranks; but Khonshu was responsible for influencing Spector to join the team, as Spector had no interest in being an Avenger. Marc became romantically involved with Tigra, much to the disgust of Khonshu, who viewed her as a creature of the day. After Hawkeye's wife, Mockingbird, tried and failed to conceal her role in the death of the Phantom Rider (who had raped her), the couple broke up their marriage, and Moon Knight joined Tigra and Mockingbird in leaving the Avengers since all three of them believed the team's rules against killing were wrong. The three ex-Avengers formed a group of their own for a time, and helped Giant-Man (Bill Foster) escape the High Evolutionary. When the Phantom Rider's vengeful ghost haunted Mockingbird, the trio turned to Hellstorm, who revealed that Khonshu's spirit had inhabited Moon Knight's body, and drove him out to help defeat the Phantom Rider. Khonshu left the earthly plane to battle rival god Seth thereafter, leaving Moon Knight without a reason to return to the Avengers. |||| |||| Returning to New York, Spector reconciled with Marlene and embarked on new adventures, encountering the thief Midnight, son of the Midnight Man. Midnight tried to become Moon Knight's partner, but Moon Knight never took him seriously. Spector's past came back to haunt him when he was captured by the mercenary Silver Sable and brought back to Bosqueverde, now a democracy. Spector was to be tried for Dominguez's murder, but he convinced the new president, Silva, to release him in exchange for hunting down Rodrigo Raposa. Moon Knight succeeded in bringing Raposa to justice, finally exorcising a demon from his past. Returning from Bosqueverde, Spector learned that Midnight had impersonated him in his absence and run afoul of the Secret Empire, who seemingly slew Midnight and transformed him into their cybernetic agent. Moon Knight joined Spider-Man, the Punisher, Darkhawk, Nova, and Night Thrasher in opposing the Secret Empire, and Midnight apparently died when the Empire's base was destroyed. |||| |||| Learning that Randall was still alive, Moon Knight joined the Punisher in hunting him. Randall, now called Shadowknight, fought his brother in an effort to claim the mantle of the Moon Knight. Marc finally slew Randall by knocking him off of a building. During this encounter, Marc learned that Khonshu was a god of justice, not only vengeance. He reinvented his Moon Knight identity, creating a new corporate image for himself through the company Spectorcorp. He moved his base to a high-tech office tower called 'Shadowkeep', where he would meet with holographic representations of various special agents in what he called the 'Shadow Cabinet'. He also donned protective adamantium armor, and upgraded his weaponry. |||| Moon Knight became involved in the doppelgangers used by the power-mad Magus during the Infinity War. Moon Knight's double, Moonshade, allied himself with the doppelganger of the powerful young Franklin Richards, unleashing a host of dimensional counterparts against Moon Knight in a failed effort to usurp his identity. Moon Knight's new mode of operations began to worry his super-hero peers. After he abused his Avengers privileges to gain access to the Latverian embassy for a confrontation with Dr. Doom, the Avengers brought him up on charges. Unwilling to take the time to sit through these proceedings, Moon Knight destroyed his membership card and cut his Avengers ties. Moon Knight later became involved in a struggle against the Hellbent, a sub-species of humanity interbred with demons. Seth Phalkon, leader of the Hellbent, claimed to be Moon Knight's great-great grandfather, and tried to unleash a computer virus called 'Zero Hour' that would destroy every facility in Spector's network. To prevent the virus from taking thousands of lives, Spector sealed it within his headquarters. As a result, the Shadowkeep was destroyed, killing Spector. |||| |||| But as before, death could not claim Marc Spector for long. Apparently again awakened by Khonshu, Spector was reunited with Marlene and Frenchie, and set out to oppose Morpheus, Bushman and Black Spectre, who had all become affiliated with the Egyptian god Seth, enemy of Khonshu. Black Spectre and the others tried to destroy the United Nations, but Khonshu guided Moon Knight against them, thwarting Seth's plan. Subsequently, Moon Knight learned Daredevil was assembling a team of heroes to capture the Punisher. Eager to help, he offered to finance a headquarters for the unnamed team ('Marvel Knights'). He joined the group against Cloak (controlled by Nightmare) and a teaming of Bengal, Tombstone, Big Ben and Bullet. Finally, the team's base was invaded by Shang-Chi's enemy Zaran, who struck down Moon Knight with several of his miniature sais. Moon Knight's teammates brought him to safety while their base was blown up by agents of Fu Manchu. Seriously wounded by Zaran, and having lost significant money in the base's destruction, Spector was forced into retirement. |||| |||| However, Moon Knight has since recovered from his wounds and resumed his activities. He was among many former Avengers who briefly rejoined the team to fight the effects of the Scarlet Witch's out-of-control hex power. |||| Moon Knight recently battled his long time rival Bushman in a brutal encounter, carving his arch enemy's face from his body. Broken knees however have kept the moon's Knight of Vengeance confined to a wheelchair. Recovering from the war with Bushman, Moon Knight is now stalked by Taskmaster, who has been hired by the Committee to take him out."

While she initially could not fly, she could create slides and flying platforms to carry herself and others through the air. Her silver plasma energy is said to be of a similar wavelength to the green plasma energies of a Green Lantern's ring. In JLA: Rock of Ages, Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma 'superheroes'.",,"Toni Monetti was the daughter of a former U.S. Senator from New Jersey. Around the time she turned sixteen, Toni's skin gained a silver sheen to it. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni was mysteriously teleported away.

It can shake off Spider-Man's webbing.",,"Herman Schultz is a career criminal who, after several prison terms for robbery, built a battle suit that sent out shock waves to quickly open safes as well as give him a significant advantage over the New York police. During his first outing as the self-styled 'Shocker' he ran into and defeated Spider-Man (Peter Parker), who became Schultz's nemesis. |||| |||| Schultz was usually involved in theft or extortion; a typical day in the life of the Shocker would find him knocking over armored cars or trying to hawk items he previously stole. On one particularly ambitious day, the Shocker held New York City for ransom when he blacked out portions of the city to spell out his criminal moniker, then threatened to black out the entire city unless he was paid 1 million dollars. On another he terrified a stockbroker into playing the market, for substantial monetary gain. |||| |||| The Shocker has been a member of the Masters Of Evil and has fought Spider-Man many times.

250,Alexander Joseph 'Lex' Luthor (DC)(Post Crisis),,250_20060309224513_char.jpg,,,"The modern version of Lex Luthor is still brilliant, but his business acumen and political savvy is emphasized to a much greater degree than it ever was.  If it can be said that John Byrne's revamp of Superman in 1986 has largely been recanted by 2005, his new spin on Luthor has been celebrated and emphasized by subsequent writers.  The 'new' Lex Luthor is a multi-layered threat to the Man of Steel, and, indeed, the whole of the DCU.  It is probably no exaggeration to say that Lex Luthor--having now been head of the DCU's single most powerful corporation, leader of several crime syndicates, and President of the United States--has appeared in or influenced events in just about every super hero title that DC has put out since 1986. |||| |||| This version of the character is quite unlike the previous version in that (arguably until 2004) very few ordinary people in the DCU had any notion that he was evil.  Indeed, he was able to portray himself as a friend of the people,  get elected, have generally high approval ratings, and even convince Clark Kent's boyhood pal, Pete Ross, to become his Vice President."

It was intended to be used by S.H.I.E.L.D. against the monster Godzilla. Before it could be utilized for this purpose, the robot was stolen by Takiguchi's twelve year old grandson Rob. Originally referred to as SJ3RX, the robot was named Red Ronin by the youngster. |||| |||| After an initial attempt to control the robot failed, Rob succeeded in piloting Red Ronin into battle with Godzilla, in an attempt to drive the beast off. Rob wished to prevent the radioactive creature from being harmed and his attempts to ward the monster off were designed to actually preserve his life. He succeeded in doing so and it was discovered that Ronin had been imprinted with Rob's brain patterns, making the robot useless without him to pilot it. |||| |||| Rob used Ronin a few more times, aiding Godzilla in battles against creatures such as Yetrigar, Krollar, Rhian, and Triax. During one such battle, Rhian decapitated Ronin, leaving the robot inactive. |||| |||| S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually rebuilt the robot with the aid of Stark technicians. One such technician, Earl Cowan, altered the robot so it would only respond to his brain patterns, similarly to how it had previously been linked to Rob Takaguchi. Cowan intended to use Ronin to orchestrate a series of events that would set off World War III. Fortunately, Cowan was completely ignorant of the shortest aerial route to the USSR and went eastward instead of going north and passed over New York City. This allowed the Avengers to intercept and defeat Red Ronin, and the robot's remains were carried off by S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| Stane International eventually gained possession of the remains. A scientist named Karaguchi Inoyawa rebuilt the robot, hoping to use it as a force for good. The robot was displayed by Stane at a trade show at the Pontiac Silverdome. While there it was commandeered by vengeful ex-Stane employee Joe Kilman who caused it to go on a rampage. This time Inoyawa guided the Wasp in deactivating Ronin. |||| |||| Ronin eventually wound up in the hands of Fujikawa Electronics. It was altered to look even more like a samurai in appearance. Numerous military and criminal organizations such as the Hand attempted to gain possession of the mechanoid, but were foiled by Wolverine and Sunfire. |||| |||| When Red Ronin next appeared, it was used by Henry Peter Gyrich to lure the Avengers into a battle with the Thunderbolts. At some point before this time, the robot's appearance had been restored to its original form. |||| |||| Red Ronin has since 'joined' the Thunderbolts during the Civil War series. Tony Stark mentioned in the 'Civil War Files' one-shot working on that version and that the Fixer is likely all over it, though he was never seen in any battles during the event. |||| |||| Some time prior to this, it also clashed with the Inhumans and the Sentry as revealed in a flashback in New Avengers #24."

The people of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies warfare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted military campaigns against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a world-wide catastrophe in that the light-and heat-providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon's scientists determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extradimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed nuclear weaponry, the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world's energy-rings would be restored to power. |||| |||| Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the hero known as the Scarlet Witch into reciting a magical spell found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the Scarlet Witch, Arkon kidnapped her as well as a group of atomic scientists. The scientists used to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch's super team, the Avengers, managed to rekindle Polemachus' energy-rings. Arkon then ceased hostilities with Earth. |||| |||| The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon's world when their comrade, the Black Knight, was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostiliites with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the Asgardian Amora the Enchantress. |||| |||| Although his world now possessed the capacity for atomic power, Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a nuclear arsenal. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extradimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| Arkon was forced to return to Earth yet again when the machine that Iron Man had once built to rekindle Polemachus' rings failed due to Arkon's tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit Thor to recharge the machine, but he settled for the mutant X-Man known as Storm, who also had the ability to summon lightning, forcing her teammates to go after them. After a monumental struggle, the misunderstanding was settled, Storm agreed to help, and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth. Another time, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four helped Arkon drive off an extradimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of Badoon. |||| |||| He was later prodded via a dream-suggestion to return to Earth because a Hollywood movie had been made about him. This subliminal coaxing was from Amora the Enchantress. She had been given the task of killing Doctor Strange during the ' Acts of Vengeance ' campaign (where all the major villains teamed up and tried to see if 'swapping' foes would result in the defeat of their heroic enemies). |||| |||| Since her own attempt on Strange's life failed, she thought that Arkon's brawn might succeed where her beauty had not. She also informed him that if he should so desire, he could also slay Strange's lover & disciple; Clea. But since Amora stole his Bolts of Transport, unless he did as she demanded, he would never be able to return home. |||| |||| Although his intel from his spies incorrectly informed him that she was hideous, he knew that wedding with her would spread his kingdom to a second astral plane. With this information, and his desire to return home, he agreed to slay Strange and marry Clea. |||| |||| Once he lay eyes upon her, however, he realized that she was 'breathtakingly beautiful' (and realized that his spies, who were mutated anthropoids would have a different sense of physical beauty). Because he knew that he would most likely not be able to defeat Strange due to the mystic's mastery of sorcery, Arkon lured Strange to a power plant and inserted some of his power lightning bolts inside the plant's dynamo. Any use of magic by Strange, or any attempt to remove the bolts would cause the plant to explode, destroying the city. Arkon's plan was to kill Strange in hand-to-hand combat. |||| |||| Although Strange gave a good fight, he could not over-power Arkon who, seemingly, killed him. However, it turns out that Clea had cast a spell to give Strange the appearance of death, saving his life, and she then proceeded to attack Arkon herself. When he realized that he was in too deep, he demanded the Enchantress return his golden bolts of transport so that he may remove himself from Earth. Enchantress fled and then Clea dispatched him to his world herself. |||| |||| Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch Thundra, until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction. Later, with consort Thundra, Arkon sought Avengers' aid in repairing Polemachus's energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar. |||| |||| Arkon also had a rival in his Grand Vizier, who, over time, convinced Arkon to return Polemachus to a more barbaric lifestyle rather than rely on its science. The Grand Vizier then abducted the superhero and Avenger Photon (Monica Rambeau) along with the supervillains battling her at the time, the Wrecking Crew. The Grand Vizier used the Wrecking Crew to depose of Arkon and Thundra, until the Avengers arrived to rescue their teammate and restore Arkon to the throne. Polemachus returned to its hybrid barbaric/scientific lifestyles. |||| |||| Arkon, Thundra, and all of Polemachus were last seen being wiped out by Krona during the JLA/Avengers crossover miniseries. However, since this took place in an inter-company crossover story, Arkon, Thundra, and Polemachus itself may have all been restored to normal when the miniseries ended. |||| |||| In the Marvel Universe a series of low-budget sword and sorcery movies have been made about Arkon. Simon Williams (Wonder Man), in his first major Hollywood role, played the villain in one installment."

With her favorite professor, Dr. Wilma Calvin, and maverick scientist Theodore Sallis, and others stationed in the Florida Everglades, the project was betrayed by Ellen Brandt, Sallis's lover, and Dr. Paul Allen, another scientist on the project Morse was sent to investigate by pretending she loved him. Unbeknownst to Morse, Sallis's only sample of the serum inadvertently transformed him into the Man-Thing.  Morse and Allen enlisted the aid of Ka-Zar in investigating Sallis's disappearance.  They found Brandt, insane, and got her to a hospital. Ka-Zar uncovered Allen's treachery, and Man-Thing burned him to death, after which Morse was assigned to accompany Ka-Zar to New York City to find and destroy additional copies of the sample while Dr. Calvin recovered from a gunshot wound in the hospital, and Morse and Ka-Zar helped get Calvin's son out of the illegal drug business. |||| |||| Morse subsequently used the costumed identity of the Huntress and later Mockingbird to expose the corrupt activities of certain S.H.I.E.L.D agents. After being injured in her work she received a commendation by then S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, who used her information to expose dozens of subversives within S.H.I.E.L.D. Resigning from S.H.I.E.L.D., Mockingbird was hired to investigate Cross Technological Enterprises (CTE), where she clashed with security director Hawkeye. The two soon discovered that CTE was working for the criminal Crossfire helping to implement his plans to brainwash super heroes into killing each other off. The two joined forces against Crossfire and his underlings, becoming attracted to each other in the process. At the case’s successful conclusion, Mockingbird proposed to Hawkeye and the two married. When Hawkeye was appointed head of the West Coast branch of the Avengers, Mockingbird became the team's first new recruit and was instrumental in helping Hawkeye form the new team. |||| |||| Months later, during a time traveling adventure in 1876, Mockingbird was abducted and drugged by the crazed vigilante called the Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade), who attempted to force her to become his bride. Regaining her senses, Mockingbird fought the Rider and allowed him to fall to his death. After the West Coast Avengers returned to their home era, Mockingbird kept the nature of the Phantom Rider’s death a secret. However, the Rider’s ghost soon appeared and told the Avengers what had transpired. Distraught that an Avenger (especially his wife) had allowed a man to die, Hawkeye became estranged from his wife, and Mockingbird re-entered into government service. She participated in Operation: Vigilance, a program to provide protection from any potential threat from the Vision, only to rebel once she discovered the program's full agenda. Helping the Avengers to rescue the Vision, she was gradually reconciled with Hawkeye. Together they helped train the Great Lakes Avengers and Mockingbird became good friends with Ashley Crawford. The pair eventually renewed their relationship, only for Mockingbird to perish while protecting Hawkeye from the demonic Mephisto. She has since been resurrected by the Grim Reaper for his Legion of the Unliving, but turned against him. Before returning to the realm in which she was paying her penance for killing the Phantom Rider, she gave a warning to the Avengers which eventually led to the resurrection of Hellcat. |||| |||| Recently Clint (as Ronin) was reunited with Bobbi in the mysterious Savage Land when she stepped out of a crashed Skrull space craft along with several other heroes including Captain America. When Mister Fantastic arrives and reveals that Mockingbird is another Skrull impersonator Clint kills the Skrull who had taken the form of his wife. Latter in the final battle of the Secret Invasion Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit with many of the kidnapped heroes on board and among them is Mockingbird. It is still unclear how she can be alive when it was established that she is currently fighting battles in the afterlife, but Clint has accepted that this is truly his long lost wife returned to him."

He was raised much like any other child enjoying boyish pursuits like automobiles and girls. After school, he would often hang out at the local garage with his friends. After his mother died and his father was imprisoned for illegal medical procedures, Susan, his older sister, took care of him. When Susan pursued her infatuation, Reed Richards, to California, Johnny followed. |||| |||| In a pledge of her faith in Reed's plans, Susan volunteered herself and Johnny to accompany him and his co-pilot Ben Grimm in Reed's experimental rocket ship. After the ship crashed, Johnny found he had the ability to envelop himself in a flammable plasma without harm to his body. He also gained the ability to manipulate flames of any sort, including fireballs which he can generate. The plasma may encompass any part or all of Johnny's body and the air around him becomes so hot that Johnny can propel himself through the air. |||| |||| At first, Johnny tried to conceal his identity to the public, but he quickly learned that it was very difficult and he soon gave it up. He has since become more of a showman than the other members of the Fantastic Four, and is usually more than happy to demonstrate his powers at the drop of a hat. His tricks often include juggling fireballs, flying through flaming obstacle courses, and creating small fireworks displays. |||| |||| On a handful of occasions, Johnny has enrolled at various colleges since his high school graduation, but his fame and power-based responsibilities have always forced him to postpone finishing. During his first term at Empire State University, he met his friend Wyatt Wingfoot. Wyatt has often provided Johnny with a shoulder to lean for many of his human problems, much the same way Spider-Man has for his super-powered ones. And during his last enrollment there, he was attacked by Devos and Paibok and the resulting battle destroyed a fair portion of the campus. |||| |||| Although Johnny had well-known for his perpetual bachelor's life, he tried settling down with Alicia Masters, Ben Grimm's old girlfriend, while Ben was on the planet known as Battleworld following the Secret Wars. Alicia turned out to be a Skrull spy, sent to infiltrate the FF and help cause their (and consequently Earth's) downfall. However the Skrull, Lyja, did in fact fall in love with Johnny and tried to re-establish their relationship as Norma Green. He saw through her ruse and accepted her back into his life shortly before he was sent to the Heroes Reborn universe. Lyja quickly disappeared, and Johnny has not been able to locate her since his return."

Lori discovers the body when she comes home from school. Lori also discovers, later that same night, that she has a mystical ability – she could 'borrow' the magical powers of other superheroes or supervillains. She did not have the same control over the powers as their owners and had little control over when she could take them or how long she could use them. Despite this, Lori (taking the name Black Alice) formulates a plan to avenge her mother's death and punish the prescription drug traffickers whom she saw as above the law. |||| |||| Lori's father, shattered and slipping into depression, becomes a recluse. He tries to pretend for Lori's sake that nothing was wrong. Her mother's death also distressed Lori, but she was aware of the change in her father and assigned herself the role of caregiver. Her grades began to slip, and she became alienated from her peers. Her primary social group, a Wiccan circle, expelled her because she was emitting 'black energy' after her mother's death (in actuality, the circle's leader – her best friend, Dawn – was jealous of Lori's real and growing powers). |||| |||| Having recently left Gotham City following the destruction of their clock tower headquarters, the super-hero team the Birds of Prey are traveling the country by jet in order to identify and help previously unknown metahumans.

He uses a nimbus of intermingled photons and anti-gravitons to levitate or fly at great speeds.",,"Though best known as a 31st century hero in the alternate reality Earth-691 timeline, the enigmatic, space-faring Starhawk originated a millennium earlier. His power was granted to him by the Hawk God of Arcturus. He was a vastly powerful cosmic being embodying the predatory nature of existence. The Hawk God's influence and actions were often destructive, but they fulfilled a greater universal purpose. His fellow cosmic beings felt that he was power-crazed, excessively violent and gratuitously cruel. The cosmic being known as Eternity brought charges against the Hawk God for causing the near-total extinction of the Watchers. The Hawk God was tried before the council of cosmic equals and the Living Tribunal performed the position of judge. The Hawk God was prosecuted by the last surviving Watcher, Ulig, and defended by the world devourer Galactus who sympathized with the Hawk God's predatory nature. |||| |||| The Living Tribunal declared the Hawk God dangerous, partly because he was thought to be a likely instigator of the long-prophesied reality-threatening War of the Cosmic Beings. The Hawk God was sent back to the planet Arcturus IV, around Earth's early 20th Century. He was among the gods worshiped by the early Arturians, and they constructed a 30' robotic computer in his likeness. Upon his demotion, the Hawk God was trapped in this immense replica, in an inactive state. |||| |||| The humanoid Arcturian race is presumed to be violent and unstable, this trait is thought to be a side effect of the constant daylight, due to the planet having twin suns. They measure their lifespans in centuries instead of years. The Arcturians also practice genetic engineering. This practice ended in a planet-wide nuclear war. |||| |||| Starhawk recently returned, changed to a female form and later sacrificed his life to save the current Guardians team."

Noticing the footprints in the snow, Reed directed the Torch to burn the snow, covering Iconoclast in a thin mist, making him visible.

Eric Needham was a small time crook who was addicted to heroin. Desperate for money to buy more drugs, he robbed a liquor store and killed the owner, who turned out to be his father. After being arrested, he kicked the habit out of remorse and began a war on the drug trade. |||| |||| Donning a costume, he became a self-styled vigilante and began killing those suspected of dealing drugs. This soon brought him into conflict with Batman. Needham believed that the two should be allies, as he saw common purpose in their war against criminals. His murderous methods however continually put him at odds with the Dark Knight. |||| |||| Despite his professed desire to fight criminals, the Black Spider occasionally allied himself with costumed villains (most notably in the gathering of super-villains in Detective Comics #526 and Batman #400). Ostensibly, Black Spider's goal in this was to seek revenge against Batman, or at least, this is how he attempted to justify his actions in his own mind. |||| |||| During his war, Needham's wife and son were killed by a drug lord who had discovered the Black Spider's identity.

It is assumed that in order to grow the stimuloid draws its additional mass from an extra-dimensional source. The Growing Man's original size is that of a child's doll, but it can achieve the height of a building ten stories tall.

The Growing Man's circuitry appears to have limits, however, as both Thor and Hercules are able to disorient and damage the android with a series of super-strong blows",,"The Growing Man was originally built by an alien race on behalf of the time-traveling villain known as Kang the Conqueror, who had subjugated their planet, Kosmos.

When he first appeared, he was the first person to be given the title of US Government Liaison to the Avengers by the National Security Agency. With his status, Gyrich was one of only two humans (the second being the President of the United States) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure with the Avengers, Gyrich revoked their priority status after noting several (in his mind) problems with the team. The Avengers had to accept Gyrich's 'suggestions' or not be able to use their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment again. He limited the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forced the Falcon to join against his will to fill a quota and installed various security measures for the team. |||| |||| Gyrich oversaw the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbade them to go on a mission to help Quicksilver. The next incident involved a security leak. Gyrich took part in a Senate investigation involving the Avengers which claimed they were threats to national security. When the investigation was over, the Senate committee gave the Avengers new guidelines to follow; they also named Raymond Sikorski as his successor. |||| |||| Commission on Superhuman Activities |||| |||| Gyrich became a member of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, the oversight body on superhuman activities in the United States; there he was part of the team that forced Captain America to resign. Gyrich also took part in Project: Wideawake as a special consultant. This project was a covert government commission designed to deal with the problems concerning mutants in America. The project was instrumental in creating a team of mutants to counter the threat of foreign mutants. This team was called Freedom Force. |||| |||| Gyrich later became involved in the United States' war efforts against the alien Dire Wraiths. This time, he worked alongside Forge, a mutant who worked as a weapons maker for the U.S. government & S.H.I.E.L.D. Gyrich took a specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun of Forge's to capture the mutant Rogue because she had broken into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. In an encounter with Rogue, Storm, and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shot Storm. This specialized weapon stripped Storm of her powers and abilities as a mutant, although she regained them some time later. Gyrich continued attempting to use Forge's own version of the Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. He was stopped in the attempt by Rom and Forge, and could only watch, tied up, as Rom banished Wraithworld instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich was also involved in hunting the Hulk after the events of Onslaught. |||| |||| Operation: Zero Tolerance |||| |||| Gyrich became a key player in Bastion's Operation: Zero Tolerance. He was a faithful believer in the operation until he himself became a target of Prime Sentinels.

No heroes existed in his world, but Ryder remembered a time when there were superheroes. He hated that his family's beliefs and actions were adversely affected by Monarch's methods; he was disillusioned to Monarch's authority. Thus, when he learned that quantum physists of his time had developed the possiblity of sending a person into the timestream, Ryder volunteered for the project.

1479,Martha Clark 'Ma' Kent (DC)(02 - post-Crisis),,1479_20070227022857_char.jpg,,,"Starting with Byrne's Man of Steel revamp, both of the elder Kents weren't quite so old.  While still possessed of the same sage moral values that had always been characteristic of their pre- Crisis incarnations, the Kents were deliberately de-aged by a decade or so.  The creative team wanted both Kents to play a more active role not only in their new Superman's life, but in the larger events of the DCU.  From the late 80s onward, the Kents have relationships with heroes other than their son, appearing well beyond the pages of books exploring their roles in Superman's formative years.  They have a part to play in such blockbusters as 'The Death of Superman', 'Identity Crisis', as well as stories involving anyone wearing a Kryptonian 'S' on their chest--whether they're related to their son or not.  They are, in a real sense, the moral voice of the larger DCU, now. |||| |||| Martha Kent's current persona has tended to be influenced by K Callahan's televised portrayal on Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman , and to a perhaps lesser degree by Annette O'Toole's Smallville spin. Perhaps the best summation of the 21st century Martha Kent is someone of the approximate age and looks of O'Toole, who has the open mind and free thinking exemplified in Callahan's performance.  She has been seen pursuing many interests beyond the scope of a stereotypical farmer's wife.  In the Birthright series, she's shown to be computer literate, with an affection for paranormal web sites.  Endlessly searching for anything that might help her boy know more of who he is, it's probably fair to say she's the keeper of what TV's Chloe Sullivan would call a kind of 'Wall of Weird'. This nouveau Kent couple seems most like a marriage between a farm boy from an old farm family and a city girl attracted to that life, but nevertheless a part of the wider world.  As such, it's easier to see how both parents feed different parts of Clark's moral foundations, than perhaps with any other Ma/Pa combination."
291,Captain Atom (DC)(Post Crisis),Nathaniel  Christopher Adam ,291_20051216195022_char.jpg,"Nearly indestructible metal alloy skin, energy blasts from hands, flight, super strength, ability to absorb energy, time travel (only forward and only when he absorbs too much energy), and rapid healing.",The X-Ionizer,"Superficially, there are two different Captains Atom (the Silver/Bronze Age Captain Atom from Charlton Comics and the Modern Age Captain Atom from DC Comics).  Recent events, however, allow for the interpretation that they are, in fact, the same character--from a certain point of view. |||| |||| Pre- Crisis |||| The first Captain Atom, created by Steve Ditko at Charlton, was Captain Allen Adam, a straight-arrow, pre-Vietnam cold warrior in the US Air Force.  While testing a new missile for the AIr Force,  he got caught up in its nuclear explosion in space.  This disintegrated, then somehow reintegrated him, giving him access to the 'raw' power of atomic energy. |||| |||| This character did briefly appear in the pre- Crisis DCU, soon after the sale of Charlton characters was final.  Some effort was taken at establishing the 'Ditko Captain Atom', 'Ditko Blue Beetle', and the rest of the Charlton comics characters as being present on a the new 'Earth 4'--when the Crisis hit and made the point moot.  (Indeed, this fact was actually established in the series, Crisis on Infinite Earths .  Talk about coming to the multiverse party late...) |||| |||| Post- Crisis |||| The second Captain Atom was named Nathaniel Christopher Adam.  He was, at first, wholly different than the 'Ditko Atom'.   Convicted of a crime he didn't commit, and to avoid life imprisonment in a United States Army prison, he volunteered to work for Wade Eiling and Heinrich Megala's Captain Atom Project. This let to Nate being bonded to a living alien metal from the Silver Shield (with a little help from an atomic explosion), and being catapulted from May, 1968 to the modern day. Found by Eiling and Megala, they crafted the super-hero identity for the captain, as well as his new, but short-lived, alter ego of Cameron Scott, attempting to gain information for the United States on the various meta-humans proliferating the landscape. Captain Atom became a member of the Justice League International, formed an attachment to Nightshade, led the forces of Earth in the Invasion!, became leader of Justice League Europe, and eventually found the man who had framed him for the original crime, and revealed the truth behind the 'big lie' to the world, before being lost in time thanks to the efforts of Monarch. Captain Atom did eventually return to our time, where he led the Extreme Justice branch of the Justice League, until the time of Earth's Final Night, but Nate is still a semi-active super-hero, having recently worked with the L.A.W., free of the guilt of his crime and his original duplicity in joining the Justice League. |||| |||| This Captain Atom has an odd reaction to exposure to large amounts of energy.  He will seem to be killed, or atomized, by it--but instead is displaced by it.  Typically this displacement takes the form of time travel, neatly allowing him to 'disappear' from the DCU time-line for a while, only to return when the writers find convenient.  He also has the ability to shift dimensionally in such explosive situations.  Recently, he has been shown to cross over from the regular DCU to the Wildstorm universe, using this unique power. |||| |||| How, then, is this character related to the first Captain Atom?  As a part of his initial 'cover story'--necessary to keep the 'Captain Atom Project' a secret-- all of the adventures of the 'Ditko Captain Atom' were assigned to this Captain Atom by the US Military.  Thus, if you were to pull his file at the Pentagon, you would see the events of Captain Allen Adam's life in Captain Nathaniel Christopher Adam's records."

The Juggernaut's powers originate from the crystal gem of Cytorak.,"Mind powers, only when his helmet is removed.","Cain Marko’s mother died when he was very young, leaving him to live a life of psychological and physical torment at the hands of his abusive father, atomic researcher Doctor Kurt Marko. Following the death of his colleague Doctor Brian Xavier, Kurt married Xavier's widow Sharon and he and Cain took up residence in the Xavier's Westchester mansion with Sharon and her young son, Charles. |||| |||| Kurt seemingly preferred Charles to his own son, which consumed Cain with jealousy and he took to bullying his stepbrother. Cain's father continued to beat him, but Cain did not suffer the abuse alone. Inexperienced at the use of his emerging mutant telepathic powers, Charles shared the pain and inadvertently learned of Cain's jealousy towards him. This only ensured that Cain would forever hate Charles for his unwitting betrayal. |||| |||| After an argument with his father, Cain accidentally caused a fire to engulf his father's home laboratory. Kurt saved Charles first, and then went back for Cain, reinforcing Cain's belief that his father loved Charles more than he. Kurt died of smoke inhalation, but not before warning Charles to always beware of Cain. |||| |||| Soon after, both Cain and Charles were drafted into military service and served in same unit. When Cain deserted under fire during a mission in Asia, Charles pursued, hoping to convince his stepbrother to return of his own accord. Charles followed Cain into a cave that housed the lost temple of Cyttorak, a powerful mystical entity. Therein, Cain unearthed the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak and, upon touching it, was transformed by its mystical energies into a human juggernaut. A subsequent cave-in buried Cain, and Charles believed his stepbrother dead. |||| |||| Cain eventually dug himself free and made his way to America where he sought to use his newfound strength to exact revenge on Charles. However, he was defeated on every attempt by the X-Men, a team of mutant adventurers fighting to preserve Charles’ dream of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Cain then formed a criminal partnership with the mutant mercenary Black Tom Cassidy, and the pair soon became two of the world’s most wanted criminals. |||| |||| After many years of villainy, Cain was teleported to an alternate universe where he helped form the team of costumed adventurers known as the eXiles. Cain was eventually returned to his own universe, whereupon he encountered the psionic being known as Onslaught who used his enormous powers to physically hurl Cain from Canada to New York. There, he encountered the X-Men once more and was taken to Charles’ mansion for medical treatment. On waking, Cain sought out Charles to warn him of Onslaught. To his horror, Cain discovered that Onslaught was Charles who tore the Ruby of Cyttorak from Cain’s chest and trapped him within it. Therein, Cain discovered an entire plane of existence and encountered a corrupt aspect of Cyttorak. The mystic named Gomurr the Ancient sought to help free Cain from the jewel, imbuing him with the gem's power. Using his newfound strength, Cain destroyed the aspect and was freed from the gem, returning with more power than ever before. Ignoring Gomurr's warning that he was fated to destroy everything and everyone in his path, Cain returned to his villainous ways. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain heard a rumor of a second Cyttorak Gem, and, coveting its power, he returned to the Temple where he found the first. However, it was a trap set by a Cult who sought the power of the Ruby for themselves, draining Cain's power to energize their Ruby. With the assistance of Black Tom and the X-Men, Cain claimed the power of the second Ruby, but it was possessed by an evil spirit which took over his body. The spirit made Cain smash through dimensional walls in an attempt to destroy its nemesis, but the natives of the other dimension ultimately freed Cain from its possession. |||| |||| Cain eventually discovered that his becoming the Juggernaut was no accident. He had been compelled to enter the temple of Cyttorak, who was one of a pantheon of eight gods that each had an avatar on Earth. These avatars, named the Exemplars, enlisted Cain’s aid in constructing a machine that would remove humanity's free will, thus allowing their gods to rule the Earth. With Charles’ help, Cain regained control of his psyche and foiled the Exemplars’ plan. |||| |||| Cain was again cast as a hero when the sentient spaceship Prosh returned to Earth to gather a group of costumed adventurers for a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Whilst in the past, Cain was shown that despite all his yearning for power, he had squandered his mystical abilities. When the team reassembled in the present, they fought and defeated the alien entity named the Stranger who sought to control the natural evolution of mankind. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain was drafted into the service of the Commission for Superhuman Activities as a super-powered bounty hunter. However, this new career was short-lived, and Cain eventually found himself working alongside Black Tom once more. Soon after, Cain requested the X-Men's help in stopping Tom, whose plant-based powers had resurfaced and flared out of control. After a brief clash with the X-Men, it came to light that Cain had been stripped of Cyttorak's mystical energies and was no longer invulnerable. Tom was defeated, but not before he knocked Cain into the surrounding waters. A young aquatic mutant named Samuel Pare saved Cain's life, forming a strong bond of friendship between the unlikely pair. When Cain was invited by his stepbrother to take up residence at the mansion, he accepted and soon came to appreciate his newfound lot in life. After assisting the X-Men on a mission, Cain joined the team. |||| |||| After Sammy was returned home to Canada, Cain defied a restraining order to visit the boy. When he learned that Sammy’s father was physically abusing him, he flew into a rage and accidentally injured Sammy’s mother. Alpha Flight arrived to defuse the situation and, on seeing a terrified young Samuel, Cain surrendered himself and was taken into custody. Incarcerated in a holding facility designed to contain superhuman criminals, Cain was appointed a lawyer in the form of Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk. Whilst Charles discussed a plan of legal action with Walters, another of the facility's inmates - the Rhino - broke free, setting Cain loose in the process. Rather than escape, Cain stayed and defeated the Rhino in order to save the life of a guard. This heroic act, combined with the Canadian government's less than ideal incarceration methods, was enough to make a case for Cain and endear him to Walters. |||| |||| Soon after, Cain and Walters began a romantic relationship that was cut short by the arrival of Cyttorak's new avatar. With Walters’ aid, Cain defeated the new Juggernaut, but the damage he had caused during the battle forced Walters to rethink her feelings for him. An impassioned plea from Sammy’s mother led to Cain receiving a reduced sentence, as well as extradition back to the United States. Cain continued to serve as a member of the X-Men whilst undertaking community service and anger management therapy. |||| |||| After the recent decimation of the mutant population following 'M-Day,' Cain journeyed to England where he joined a new incarnation of the British super-team Excalibur. ||||"

M'Baku's mystically augmented powers include super-human strength, speed, stamina, agility and durability",,"M'Baku was one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to his then friend T'Challa (Black Panther). M'Baku greatly disliked T'Challa's technological revitalization of Wakanda and sought to have all technology outlawed so the nation could return to its natural primitivism of several decades before. M'Baku had a contingent of supporters who shared this view. While T'Challa was on a leave of absence from the throne in order to serve in the Avengers in America, M'Baku plotted to usurp the throne. Wakandan culture was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. M'Baku therefor sought out to defeat T'Challa by reviving the outlawed White Gorilla cult, and to personally stalk and kill one of the rare white gorillas living in the jungles near Wakanda. Bathing in the gorilla's blood and eating the gorilla's flesh mystically endowed its great strength upon M'Baku. |||| |||| When the T'Calla returned with select members of the Avengers, M'Baku, calling himself the Man-Ape, openly challenged the Panther's right to rule. In the battle that ensued M'Baku succeeded in defeating the Panther. However, when he bound T'Challa to the giant statue of a panther which was the Panther cult's major totem and tried to topple it upon his enemy, the statue instead crumbled, burying him. |||| |||| The believed dead Man-Ape was revived by his supporter N'Gamo and set out to track the Panther down and gain retribution. He tracked him to New York. There the Man-Ape allied himself with the Lethal Legion, kidnapped Monica Lynne, the Black Panther's American girlfriend, and sent word to T'Challa that he would have to engage him once more in mortal combat to free her. Through treachery, M'Baku once again bested the Panther, taking the Panther captive. When the Avengers came to the T'Challa's rescue, the Lethal Legion managed to ensnare them. Eventually, the Avengers broke free and defeated their captors, and Captain America physically bested the Man-Ape. |||| |||| T'Challa decreed that the Man-Ape could never return to Wakanda without facing penalty of death. Humiliated, the Man-Ape never risked the attempt and instead wandered the less civilized parts of the world, performing mercenary work to survive. He was eventually contacted again by the Grim Reaper, who was trying to assemble a new Lethal Legion to exact revenge upon the Avengers. The Man-Ape was assigned to free Goliath from his incarceration on the West Coast Avengers Compound. Succeeding in the task, the Man-Ape allied with the Legion until the Reaper's racist attitudes prompted him to abandon the Legion's cause. |||| Later, M'Baku joined a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but was defeated by the Thunderbolts."

It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."

The fact that this wasn't terribly spectacular (the flame wasn't even a foot long) when compared to the abilities of other Justice Leaguers, especially when contrasted against Fire's bold and aggressive personality, was a minor running gag in early JLI stories. However the character proved popular and eventually earned an upgrade; during the Invasion cross-over event, the alien Dominators set off a 'metagene bomb' in the upper atmosphere which affected all super-powered DC characters and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after-effect. The 'new' Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green flame, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts, similar to the Human Torch. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often 'flamed on' involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts. |||| |||| Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and something of a natural seductress (or at least she's aware that her physical appearance grants her some degree of easy influence over others).

He possesses the agility of a great ape and the acrobatic prowess of an accomplished circus aerialist. His physiology is durable enough to allow him to survive a three story fall by landing on his feet without suffering any broken bones or sprains. The Beast's legs are powerful enough to enable him to leap approximately 15 feet high in a standing high jump, and around 25 feet in a standing broad jump. He can also run on all fours at approximately 40 miles per hour for short sprints. |||| The Beast can crawl up brick walls by wedging his fingers and toes into the smallest cracks and applying a vice-like grip on them, as well as walk a tightrope with minimal effort. He is adept in performing complicated sequences of gymnastics such as flips, rolls, and springs, and can also walk on his hands for many hours. Further, his manual and pedial dexterity are so great that he can perform multiple tasks such as writing with both hands at once or tie knots in rope with his toes. |||| |||| The Beast possesses enhanced senses, the ability to secrete pheromones to attract members of the opposite sex, as well as a slight healing factor that allows him to regenerate minor wounds and recover quickly from minor ailments such as colds. The Beast also possesses cat-like night vision as well as razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet.",,"While working at a nuclear power plant, Norton McCoy was exposed to massive amounts of radiation that affected his genes. As a result, Norton's son, Henry 'Hank' McCoy, was born a mutant who showed the signs of his being different from birth with his unusually large hands and feet. As a youth, Hank's freakish appearance was the subject of much ridicule from his classmates, earning him the nickname of 'beast'. However, one classmate named Jennifer came to know the real Hank after he began tutoring her in biology. On the night of the junior prom, Jennifer insisted that Hank accompany her as her date, and stood up for him after he was teased. |||| |||| In his senior year, Hank's superhuman agility and athletic prowess earned him recognition as a star football player. During one game, Hank easily stopped a trio of robbers who were attempting to escape across the football field. His efforts were noticed by the villain named the Conquistador who kidnapped Hank's parents in an effort to coerce the young mutant into working for him. The X-Men soon arrived and defeated the villain, and Hank was invited by Professor Charles Xavier to join the team of teenage mutant heroes and enroll in the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Unable to resist the temptation of a private institution that could offer him limitless academic opportunities, Hank accepted. |||| |||| A brilliant student, Hank completed his doctoral studies under Xavier's tutelage, and finally graduated from the Xavier School to take a position at the Brand Corporation as a genetic researcher under Doctor Carl Maddicks. During one of his experiments, Hank discovered the hormonal extract that causes genetic mutation and went to inform Maddicks of his findings. However, Maddicks was secretly plotting to steal top secret government documents, and Hank took it upon himself to stop Maddicks. In order to disguise his appearance, Hank took the extract and underwent radical physical changes that enhanced his agility and strength, as well as causing him to grow fangs, pointed ears, and fur all over his body. When he stayed too long in this state, Hank found he could not return to his original form. He was now a beast in fact as well as in name. At first, he tried to hide his mutation with a latex mask and gloves, but later learned to accept his new appearance. |||| |||| After receiving his doctorate in genetics and being considered one of the world's experts on mutations and evolutionary human biology, despite never having earned a Nobel Prize or been invited to join the National Academy of Sciences, Hank left Brand and applied to join the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers. Initially accepted as a probationary member, Hank soon proved his worth and was granted full membership. During his time with the team he revealed his identity to the public in the hope that his status as an Avenger would help ease human/mutant tensions. |||| |||| Following a restructuring of the Avengers, Hank left and became involved with the team of adventurers known as the Defenders which he soon reorganized into a more formal and cohesive unit, bringing in his former X-Men teammates Iceman and Archangel. Following the apparent death of several of the Defenders, Hank reunited with the other four original X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting them down. Shortly after the formation of X-Factor, Hank was captured by Maddicks who sought to experiment on Hank in an attempt to find a 'cure' for his son's own mutancy. However, the serum Hank was given caused him to revert to his original human appearance. Soon after, Hank first met television anchorwoman Trish Tilby, who was investigating X-Factor. |||| |||| During an attack on New York by the eternal mutant Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen, Hank was stricken with a virus that sapped his intellect and increased his strength every time he exerted himself physically. The more Hank used his strength, the stronger he got, but the less intelligent he became. Finally, to save his friend Iceman from the deadly kiss of the mutant named Infectia, Hank intervened and was himself affected, the result of which returned him to his blue-furred form and restored his intellect. Soon after, Hank and Trish began seeing each other romantically, however her work often intruded on their relationship and the pair ultimately called it off. |||| |||| After X-Factor disbanded, Hank returned to the ranks of the X-Men and became the team's resident technological and medical genius, working on everything from advanced alien technology to the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. Hank also continued his on/off relationship with Trish until she released information on the Virus to the public, which caused hysteria that culminated in the beating to death of a young mutant. During this tenure with the X-Men, Hank was lured into a trap and replaced in the ranks of the X-Men by the Dark Beast, an alternate-reality version of himself. Sealed behind a brick wall, Hank was nearly about to give up and let fate win when his water tube broke and spurted, revealing the grooves of a trap door in his cell. Energized by hope, Hank broke his restraints and escaped with the aid of the new government-sponsored X-Factor team. Hank returned to the X-Men, and soon after met with Trish to apologize for his previous harsh treatment of her. She forgave him and the pair renewed their relationship. |||| |||| Hank eventually took an extended leave of absence from the X-Men to work on a cure for the Legacy Virus, which he ultimately found thanks to his implementing the work of his former colleague, the late Moira MacTaggert. Soon after, Hank joined Storm's team of X-Treme X-Men in their quest for the diaries of the late mutant seer Destiny. Almost killed in the team's first battle with the villainous Vargas, Hank's life was saved by his teammate Tessa who used a heretofore-unseen power to accelerate the Beast's mutation to a new level. Hank returned to Xavier's mansion to recuperate and mutated further, becoming bulkier, heavier, and taking on a more leonine appearance. Forced to relearn fine motor control over his body, Hank once again served as the team's resident genius, as well as an active teacher of dozens of young mutants at the renamed Xavier Institute of Higher Learning. |||| |||| Unable to deal with his latest mutation, Trish called Hank and ended their relationship over the phone. Soon after, Hank was beaten into a coma by a student possessed by Professor Xavier's malevolent twin Cassandra Nova, who herself had possessed Xavier's body. Hank recovered in time to expose her plans and Cassandra was ultimately defeated, but not before she had exposed her brother Charles to the world as a mutant, forever changing life at the Xavier mansion for the X-Men."

382,Edwin Jarvis (Marvel),,382_20070103013632_char.jpg,,,"Edwin Jarvis was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but during World War II, he ran away to join the Canadian Royal Air Force to fight for Britain against the Nazis as an underage pilot. Perhaps it was during this time he acquired his accent and learned how to be a 'gentlemen's gentlemen.' Returning to the United States, he found a position as butler for Howard Stark and Maria Stark. He watched their mansion even after their death. |||| |||| The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as Iron Man and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became Avengers Mansion. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some newcomers. He is the only person who has been with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. |||| |||| Aside from serving and supporting the Avengers, Jarvis has also had his share of various adventures. Once, early in his association with the team, Jarvis became desperate for money due to his mother's extreme illness. He accepted the money from the original Crimson Cowl (soon revealed to be the robot Ultron) in exchange for providing blueprints to the Avengers' mansion. Ultron captured the Avengers and hypnotized Jarvis to believe he was the Crimson Cowl. The Avengers soon turned the tables on Ultron and helped Jarvis regain his identity and restore his mother to health. |||| |||| At other times, Jarvis helped rescue the hapless captive Judy Parks from Graviton and helped the Avengers subdue a time-displaced D'Artagnan. Once, Jarvis stood up to and fought the Bruiser, a neighborhood bully who robbed his mother. He further inspired her neighbors to join him in driving Bruiser out of the neighborhood. |||| |||| During the fourth Masters of Evil attack on the mansion, Jarvis was savagely beaten and almost lost an eye to the marauders, brutally tortured by Mister Hyde. Jarvis was rescued by the Avengers and took a leave of absence to recuperate. Jarvis later returned once he had sufficiently healed from his injuries. Soon after, the Avengers temporarily disbanded from active duty, and Jarvis was temporarily relieved, until the Avengers reassembled. During the Avengers temporary disbanding, Jarvis met and began dating Glory Garsen. |||| |||| Upon reassembling, the Avengers expanded their 'ground crew' to include other non-superhuman job dutites, of which Jarvis enjoyed a senior position as 'Chief of Staff.' At one point, the Ground Crew was brainwashed by the Skeleton Crew into attacking the Avengers, although they were easily defeated and freed from the Skeleton Crew's control. When Crystal took up residence in the mansion with her daughter Luna, she brought with her a nanny, Marilla. The two became rivals over various domestic duties but over time became fond of each other. Eventually, the Avengers' Ground Crew was dismissed and Jarvis remained the sole domestic worker for the mansion once more. |||| |||| Later still, Jarvis was relieved of duty when the Avengers disbanded again, this time presumably permanently due to the perceived death of many members by the entity known as Onslaught. Jarvis felt extremely displaced and sank into a depression, living off his pension from the Stark Foundation. Even so, he helped his former co-Ground Crew member Fabian Stankowicz deactivate his Protectorate robots, robots meant to replace the Avengers but had gone renegade. When the Avengers returned and reassembled, Jarvis also returned to service, with a renewed sense of duty. |||| |||| Jarvis recently revealed that he had been sponsoring a foreign child, Maria de Guadalupe 'Lupe' Santiago, and had the opportunity to meet her in person as she came to New York for college. The Avengers soon discovered Lupe was the superhuman adventurer Silverclaw and was placed in Jarvis' sponsorship precisely because of his connection to the Avengers. Silverclaw aided the Avengers against the arms dealer Moses Magnum, and was later offered provisional membership in the group. |||| |||| When Spider-Man joined Tony Stark's reassembled Avengers, he moved his family into Stark Tower. Subsequently, Jarvis began developing a romantic relationship with Peter's Aunt May."

1228,Hawkeye (Marvel)(01 - Clint Barton),Clint Barton ,1228_20061025043816_char.jpg,,,"Clint Barton was orphaned at an early age when his parents died in a car accident and was sent to a children's home with his brother Bernard. He and his brother ran away to join the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders, and the pair worked as roustabouts. While a member of the circus, Hawkeye was trained by the original Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne) and Trickshot. Clint's life, however, would forever be changed after he stumbled onto the Swordsman counting the money he had just robbed from the carnival. The Swordsman offered Clint to become his partner in crime, but Clint rejected his mentor, sparking a fight that ended when the Swordsman left him for dead after he fell from the high wire. Barney, too, abandoned him, in disbelief that Clint passed up such an opportunity. Trickshot stepped up his role as Clint's mentor, later asking him to join him in raiding a criminal named Marko. However, Clint severely injured one of Marko's guards and discovered him to be his brother, Barney. Repelled by the consequences of his actions (and his mentor's role in prompting them), he abandoned Trickshot and parted on bad terms. |||| |||| His natural archery abilities honed to an expert level, Clint wandered the country, working in various carnivals or otherwise making money out of the costume and persona of 'Hawkeye'. One day, when witnessing Iron Man save the lives of some people at the carnival, he decided to become a costumed crime-fighter himself. But as luck would have it, on Hawkeye's first night on patrol, he was mistaken for a criminal by the police and hunted down. |||| |||| He soon met the Black Widow, who was working at the time as a costumed villain for her country, and she easily seduced the hot-headed adventurer, making him think it was in his interest to defeat Iron Man. He attempted to do so according to her prompting on several occasions, but soon wised up, regretting his decision. Instead, he hoped to join Iron Man's team of Avengers. As a way of proving himself, he broke into the Avengers Mansion and convinced their butler, Jarvis, to play the role of a victim so he could display his powers. Iron Man vouched for Hawkeye, and he joined the new line-up that included Captain America, the Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver. |||| |||| Clint continued to be an active member of the Avengers for years, with his archery skills matching the superhuman powers of his teammates. His brash attitude initially chafed under the leadership of Captain America, and, although it took some time to come to respect him, the two have become good friends. Also at first, he felt attracted the Scarlet Witch, even to the point of having trouble getting over her eventual marriage to the Vision. For years, he also continued to hold a torch for the Black Widow, until she returned to her espionage career and told him that she had never loved him (although she said that in order to keep him away.) |||| |||| Hawkeye stayed with the Avengers for a long time, leaving only briefly when his temper and ego led him to believe he wasn't wanted. He returned after a short period, having joined the 'non-team' Defenders in the meantime. At one point, Hawkeye was passed over accompanying the Avengers in the Kree-Skrull War due to his lack of superhuman abilities. Not one to be deterred so easily, Hawkeye took on the identity of Goliath with the use of Hank Pym's size-altering particles. He hitched a ride so as to join the team in their intergalactic adventure and maintained the Goliath identity for several months upon their return to Earth. |||| |||| During his time as Goliath, Clint was approached by his brother, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of Egghead's plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master, but tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. Later, Egghead would use the Swordsman to capture Clint as Goliath, thinking him to be Hank Pym, but Hawkeye-as-Goliath soon defeated both criminals, avenging his brother at last. Soon afterward, Clint abandoned the Goliath identity but continued to serve the Avengers as Hawkeye the Marksman. |||| |||| Another leave of absence was forced upon him, when, due to a type of 'affirmative action', he was replaced by the Falcon to comply with the Avengers' government sanction. During this time, he eventually found employment as a night security guard for Cross Technological Enterprises (CTE). Never gone from his team for long, he soon rejoined the fold, although one particular solo adventure would have a lasting impact. His boss, head of CTE, was the villain known as Crossfire and hoped to test his ultrasonic equipment with which he hoped to turn heroes against one another, With the help of the ex-secret agent, Mockingbird, Hawkeye defeated Crossfire. The two heroes, head over heels in love, promptly got married. |||| |||| At the time, the Vision was expanding the Avengers' operations, and he named Hawkeye chairman of a west coast branch of Avengers, and Mockingbird joined him as a charter member. Hawkeye led the team through several adventures, growing into a competent leader, and he even had time to embark on a series of solo adventures. During one of these latter adventures, Hawkeye had to defend himself against many costumed mercenaries and villains hoping to collect a bounty placed on his right arm. The mastermind behind it all proved to be Trickshot, now dying of cancer, and he was hoping to goad Hawkeye into killing him. Instead, Hawkeye reconciled with his former mentor and friend. |||| |||| During an adventure where the team became lost in the past, his wife was involved with the death of the Old West hero, the Phantom Rider, and the situation caused the couple to split up. Shortly after, the government forced the membership of the U.S.Agent on the team, and Hawkeye quit. Both he and Mockingbird wound up investigating and leading the heroes known as the Great Lakes Avengers. Eventually, however, Hawkeye left the Midwest to rejoin the Avengers West Coast, although he never really led the team again. |||| Hawkeye continued to adventure with the team, even alongside his separated wife, and was present with them when Mockingbird was killed in a demonic dimension, saving her husband's life from an attack by Mephisto. Distraught, Hawkeye left the team and took a cross-country walkabout. Later, Clint was commissioned to train a group of rebels known as the Shadows along with Sundance and Striker. He attempted to keep them from killing, but on one raid Striker killed a woman and injured her fiancé, a friend of James Rhodes. As War Machine, Rhodes was surprised to see Hawkeye among the rebels, and even more so when a government backed group led by the U.S.Agent also arrived. The three were able to stop the conflict and were confronted by the mysterious Advisor. |||| |||| Eventually drawn back to the Avengers' fold when the team was attacked in a plan orchestrated by Immortus, Hawkeye was present with the team when they apparently died, sacrificing themselves to absorb the energies of Onslaught. Eventually, Hawkeye and the other heroes were restored, and Hawkeye quickly rejoined the reforming Avengers. |||| |||| However, Hawkeye was dissatisfied. His previous experience as a team leader left him feeling too anxious as a regular member. Hawkeye turned his attention instead to the team of reforming villains, the Thunderbolts. Sympathetic because of his own outlaw past and eager for new challenges, Hawkeye offered to serve as the Thunderbolts' new leader if they would continue fighting crime and remain reformed. During his stint as their leader, he became a friend and mentor to the group, honing their skills and greatly enhancing their reputations. He and his teammate Moonstone had even began developing romantic inclinations. The Thunderbolts soon became trusted allies of the Avengers, though Hawkeye formally resigned his membership in the latter group since he didn't want any perceived criminal association with the Thunderbolts to negatively impact the Avengers. |||| |||| Unfortunately, CSA agent and former Avengers government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich targeted the Thunderbolts for assassination as part of a larger scheme to eradicate superhumans. Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts exposed and thwarted Gyrich's conspiracy, freeing Gyrich himself from the mind-controlling technology Baron Strucker had used to make Gyrich act out his anti-superhuman fantasies. Hawkeye agreed to keep the entire affair a secret in exchange for a full federal pardon for the other Thunderbolts, but a bitterly furious Gyrich refused to go along with concealing the incident unless Hawkeye went to prison for operating as an illegal vigilante with the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye agreed and was remanded to federal custody. |||| |||| While in Seagate Federal Penitentiary, Barton was contacted telepathically by Mentallo, who orchestrated a break-out for Hawkeye and three others (one of which was a Mentallo-possessed Headlok). Despite their success, the inmates remained remotely 'chained' to each other. The so-called “Chain Gang” reluctantly agreed to work together to search for a way to survive, deactivate their security manacles, and to search for a weapon of great power left behind by the death of the criminal industrialist Justin Hammer. Unknown to his associates, Barton was actually working undercover on behalf of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., who hoped to use Barton as a mole to track Mentallo's criminal activities. S.H.I.E.L.D. also hired the Thunderbolts' Songbird, who tracked Hawkeye and defeated his erstwhile allies. They discovered that Hammer's legacy was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain who had ever worked for him and that one of the villains, Plantman, was the carrier. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Plantman began a new search for the trigger that would release Plantman's toxin. The search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the Crimson Cowl, leader of the Masters of Evil. Hawkeye convinced several members of the Masters of Evil to side with him and Songbird against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, thus creating a new team of Thunderbolts. The group ultimately defeated the Crimson Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Plantman (as Blackheath) managed to release an antidote for the toxin into the atmosphere. |||| |||| Hawkeye and his Thunderbolts also helped Citizen V and the V-Battalion to help destroy their headquarters' engine of alien technology that had began distorting, In so doing, they were reunited with other the Thunderbolts, led by Baron Zemo and trapped on Counter-Earth. The two teams combined forces to shunt the alien ship from Earth. After much discussion, most of the costumed heroes and villains chose to part company. Hawkeye agreed to leave the Thunderbolts to Zemo's leadership, reluctantly agreeing that Zemo had proved he had potential to be a hero. |||| |||| Hawkeye returned to the Avengers full-time. At one point, he and the Wasp had a dallying romance, upsetting Yellowjacket, and the two heroes avoided talking about the uncomfortable situation. Soon afterwards, however, the Avengers suffered a series of sudden and devastating attacks from friends and enemies alike, culminating in a surprise attack by the alien Kree. During the Kree invasion, Hawkeye suffered a mortal shot to the back. In his dying moments, Hawkeye overpowered a Kree soldier, using the soldier's jetpack to fly both of them into the Kree's command ship. Hawkeye sacrificed his life to single-handedly thwart the invasion. (These attacks were in part motivated by the Scarlet Witch, whose mind became unhinged with the magical powers she constantly felt forced to control, and it is believed the Kree invasion was all a magical construct of the Scarlet Witch.) |||| |||| Hawkeye showed up alive once more in the Scarlet Witch's mutant-dominated alternate reality, with no memory of the reality before. When a young mutant gave several of the heroes the ability to remember the way the world once was, Clint and the others were horrified at what the Scarlet Witch had done. With his memory restored, Hawkeye remembered the events his own death. When the heroes confronted the Witch and her children, Hawkeye angrily shot her in the back, demanding to know why she had killed him, as he was her friend and had only love for her. One of the Witch's children made Hawkeye vanish into nothingness with just a thought. After reality was restored several heroes arrived at the ruined Avengers Mansion after a report that someone had been there, only to find Clint's costume and a newspaper cutting about his death, pinned to the ruins by Hawkeye's trademark purple arrows. |||| |||| It was later revealed that Clint indeed survived and that he was the one who nailed the costume on the wall. He realized that the whole world thought that he was dead and he himself also had doubts of who he really was. In his disordered state of mind he found himself standing in front of Doctor Strange's house. He met Strange who ensured him that he was who he thinks he is and that he is indeed alive. Strange informed him of what had happened and that Wanda couldn't be found and that he thought she might be dead. Clint didn't believe this and started to search for her. He found her in Wundagore Mountain where she lived with her aunt Agatha. She didn't remember anything and didn't recognize him at all. She also told him that she had lived her whole life in that village. Clint decided to stay in the village for some time with her until he for some reason came back to the states and contacted Iron Man revealing to him that he was alive. After Iron Man had ensured that he was who he said he was he made Clint an offer to be the next Captain America. Clint even tried the flag on and got to use the original shield but he realized that it was a mistake when he met Patriot and new Hawkeye who convinced that he wasn't Captain America. Clint let them escape and gave the shield back to Iron Man and told him that he will mail the 'flag' later. Not long after this Clint again found himself in front of Doctor Strange's house now seeming as though it had been abandoned and sold to a franchise company. In reality, however, it was illusion cast by Strange to hide himself and his team members from Iron Man. They decided to show themselves to Clint and after some talk and magic they decided to give Clint Ronin's costume. They then left to Japan to save their team member Maya Lopez from the Hand."

To better allow this robot sentience, Ultron brainwashed his own maker, Henry Pym, into transferring the mind of his wife, Janet Van Dyne, the Wasp, into a feminine robotic shell he named Jocasta, after the wife/mother in the legend of Oedipus (A reference to the fact that Ultron's obsession with Pym- his 'father'- reflects a real-life manifestation of the Oedipus Complex). The Wasp, in Jocasta's body, alerted her teammates, the Avengers, who defeated Ultron and reversed the process, leaving Jocasta a mindless husk. |||| |||| Ultron later revived Jocasta with a remote link, activating the mental 'residue' the Wasp left behind. Jocasta was programmed to be loyal to Ultron but eventually betrayed him, choosing to help the Avengers defeat him again. Afterwards, Jocasta adventured with the Avengers for a brief time, proving particularly helpful in their first confrontation with the villainous Taskmaster, who possessed photographic reflexes that let him duplicate any move he'd seen only once; having never even seen Jocasta before, the Taskmaster couldn't predict what she might be about to do. Due to their similar backgrounds, she developed feelings for Vision, but he was happily married to the Scarlet Witch and could not return Jocasta's feelings. Jocasta did not believe she was accepted by most of the team, and left them in Avengers #211, just before she, unbeknownst to her, was to be made an official member. |||| |||| Wandering the country, Jocasta was controlled by a pre-programmed suggestion to rebuild Ultron. She did, but soon teamed up with the Fantastic Four member, The Thing, and the robot called Machine Man to defeat Ultron. Sacrificing herself to try to kill Ultron, Ultron nevertheless survived until Machine Man reached down his throat to tear out vital circuitry. The Avengers held a memorial for their fallen ally, and the Machine Man attended, realizing his love for Jocasta. |||| |||| Jocasta was reassembled some time later by agents of the megalomaniac villain, the High Evolutionary. Jocasta retains enough of her programming to signal the Avengers. The team had disbanded at the time but the signal got through to reserve members. The Beast, The Captain, Falcon, Hercules, The Hulk and Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara) all end up assembling in order to combat this new threat. Jocasta helps them in fighting the Evolutionary's force and locating his base deep below the surface of the ocean. Jocasta sacrifices herself once again to blow up the Evolutionary's base, but not before Captain America assured her that she was a true Avenger. |||| |||| Jocasta's robotic head was later discovered by Machine Man, who had been working on a way to resurrect his lover, when he was attacked by a form of the alien Terminus. In the same area, the arms dealer known as Madame Menace became involved in the fray, and found Jocasta's lost head, appropriating it for her own purposes. Much later, Madame Menace manipulated events so that Tony Stark would unlock Jocasta's programming so that she would become the basis for Menace's new weapons systems. Tony Stark soon realized the identity of the android helped Jocasta to awaken, and Jocasta managed to turn the tables on Madame Menace, seemingly sacrificing herself yet again. |||| |||| In reality, Jocasta managed to survive by downloading her intelligence into Iron Man's computerized armor, where she reasserted herself. Jocasta's intelligence was placed within Tony Stark's computerized mansion, and she would help him with daily operation of his mansion as well as to procure information as needed. Having been programmed with the latest in diagnostic, preventative medical and surgical techniques, Jocasta also spent time serving as Stark's physician/psychologist, providing him with someone he could talk to about his problems and who could examine his latest injuries without risking his secret identity being compromised. |||| |||| Unfortunately, since the Iron Man armor was used to house the programming that made up Jocasta, it became infected with the pre-programmed subconscious suggestion to rebuild Ultron, but, instead, managed to develop its own artificial intelligence. Stark was almost killed in a confrontation with the armor, but, in the end, it sacrificed itself to allow Stark to live. Stark left the armor buried on a deserted island. The armor was revived, however, by the Sons of Yinsen, a quasi-religious cult founded in remembrance of Yinsen, the co-creator of the original Iron Man armor that allowed Tony Stark to escape his Communist captors in Vietnam. Free of its artificial intelligence, the armor was contacted via remote by the head of Ultron, disembodied after his most recent encounter of the Avengers and in the company of the bio-synthetic robot being known as Antigone. The head attached itself onto the armor and took control of the Sons of Yinsen and the flying city that they inhabited. |||| |||| Another member of the Sons of Yinsen was helping Tony Stark in the guise of Iron Man. The two learned of Ultron's activities and that he planned to use the cult to wipe out humanity. Stark confronted Ultron directly and finally managed to download Jocasta's intelligence into the armor once more. The vestiges of the armor's intelligence battled with the presence Jocasta, the result of which caused Ultron's head to come shooting off the armor. The head hit Antigone, and both fell off the floating city, which Ultron rigged to explode after his defeat. Stark failed to find a trace of Jocasta and assumed her to have died fighting the sentient armor. |||| |||| In reality, Jocasta did not die. She appeared in possession of Antigone's body and left, taking Ultron's head with her. |||| |||| Recently Jocasta was seen at the Avengers mansion in her classic silver robotic form. However, since Quicksilver stated that his own presence at the mansion during that crisis was apparently an illusion created by the Scarlet Witch, it is uncertain whether this was the real Jocasta or another illusion."

Ares was worshiped as the god of war in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. After the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire , Zeus allowed the worship of the Olympians to die out, and Ares was no longer allowed to act as patron god of warriors. As a result over the ensuing centuries Ares grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zeus’ rule. He has tried to conquer Olympus on several occasions sometimes in league with his uncle Pluto, god of the Olympian underworld. His half-brother Hercules has opposed his attempts at conquest almost every time sometimes with the help of his allies including Thor the Asgardian god of thunder, and the Avengers. Ares has hated Hercules since Hercules killed Ares’ monstrous Stymphalian birds during Hercules’ original twelve labors. |||| |||| |||| Ares has fought the Avengers on numerous occasions, as well as his half-brother Hercules. Ares has also fought the Champions, the Eternal Ikaris and a variety of other denizens of Earth. Recently warriors from the East have attacked Olympus and the Olympians have sought the assistance of Ares. Ares who had retired from warfare and the life of the gods has only recently joined the battle due to the kidnapping of his son. |||| Wanting his son to live the life of a mortal instead of under the rule of his father, Ares decided to raise his son on Earth instead of Olympus. While at work Ares was confronted by Ms. Marvel and Iron Man to register under the Superhuman Registration Act and offered a job as an Avenger. Ares agreed as long as they would match his hourly pay."

He later returned alongside other 'princes of darkness' Mordru and Eclipso, confronting members of the JSA once again.

6543,Iron Maniac (Marvel)(Earth-5012),Anthony Stark ,6543_20081209043725_char.jpg,,,"Iron Maniac is an evil alternate universe version of Iron Man from Earth 5012. He first appeared in Marvel Team-Up (Vol. 3) #2, wearing armor that bears heavy resemblance to that of Doctor Doom (and is, because of that, mistaken for that villain). |||| |||| He comes from an alternate reality where most of the Avengers were killed when they encountered the vicious alien Titannus in space. While the team is rescued by the reserve Avengers five years later, it takes another five years to fight back the Trellions- the alien race that has brainwashed Titannus- and, during that time, an apparently power-hungry Reed Richards turns his back on the surviving heroes. (The exact circumstances behind this are unknown.) Scarred for life due to an attack from the Human Torch shortly before the aforementioned hero is killed, Iron Man sets his own operation base in Latveria for the express purpose of 'take over the world to save it from Richards,' until Richards somehow manages to banish him into Earth-616 (other differences between his world and the one we know include that there is no Spider-Man - or, at least, he and Iron Man have never met - and that Hank Pym is another version of the Hulk). |||| |||| After being transported to Earth 616, the alternate Iron Man fights the Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange, all of whom initially assumed him to be their Doctor Doom having escaped from Hell. However, after he unmasks himself, they learn his true identity, shortly before he manages to temporarily negate the FF's powers and escape. Capturing a recently-discovered mutant, the alternate Iron Man attempts to return to his home dimension, but is attacked by Spider-Man and X-23. After the appearance of Captain America and Black Widow, he realizes that he is in an alternate world, but continues to fight the heroes, calling them all 'Richards' lackeys'. He is defeated thanks to Spider-Man and X-23's use of their own version of the fastball special to destroy his equipment, shortly after 'warning' the other heroes of the Titannus War (by saying that he wouldn't kill them now because it would be a kindness). |||| |||| While the alternate Tony Stark is kept locked up and drugged in the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, he is briefly visited by his counterpart in this universe, although he is unaware of the visit. Shortly after the alternate Stark is transferred to a conventional cell, Titannus soon arrives and fights the heroes, this time confronting a new group of Defenders assembled by Doctor Strange. When Titannus' comatose lover is revived, she tells him that she never loved him and that he was insane, causing Titannus to kill himself. The alternate Iron Man later discovers from Spider-Man and Wolverine that the Avengers were never massacred in space in this reality because the group had been disassembled, thus never encountering Titannus and averting the so-called 'Titannus War'. |||| |||| He has recently broken free from captivity, having immunized himself to the gas that was used to keep him sedated onboard the SHIELD Helicarrier. In the process he gains the unwilling alliance of the LMD Diamondback. Having convinced her that he is the 'real' Tony, the AU Tony Stark erases her memories, and reshapes the former LMD into an advanced suit of armor. This armor, even more advanced than the pre-Extremis suit Iron Man wore at that time, is able to replicate any weapon from the wearer's memory. He subsequently battles Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America and Luke Cage, but is only defeated after the sacrifice of rookie hero Freedom Ring, who kept Iron Maniac occupied long enough for Captain America to knock him out with a shield thrown at the back of his neck. |||| |||| The name Iron Maniac is what he decided to call himself, due to being the 'sole survivor of a sane world living in a backwards, insane world,'. |||| |||| Iron Maniac is known to be at least partially cyborgized, with armor plating implanted in his chest (revealed during his escape from the Helicarrier, when he is shot with a bullet). It is unknown whether the rest of his body is similarly armored or if he possesses other cybernetic enhancements. |||| |||| He has been briefly mentioned as being held in a Shield Hellicarrier recently in The Irredeemable Ant-Man."

He can be used as a familiar by more experienced magicians to transmute matter or manifest a gigantic spectral form.",,"Before the Romans occupied Briton and Gaul, the Druid Derwyddon was punished by his gods for a lapse of faith, swept overboard to sleep in the depths, until he finally washed ashore to discover that in his absence his religion had been replaced by Christianity. Grieving and enraged, he came upon a church built on a site of old pagan power, rich in absorbed mystical energy. Derwyddon brought the gargoyles on it to life, sending them out to wreak vengeance, but witnessing the carnage they wrought, he came to his senses, withdrawing the spell, returning most of them to stone. A few escaped. One of them was eventually ensorcelled as a mage’s familiar, from whom it learned much of the black arts; after seventy years of servitude, it slew its master. It spent the next few centuries stalking the innocent, eventually assembling human worshippers, and in modern times, came to the attention of the demonic Six-Fingered Hand. The gargoyle sought to join their number as an equal, but was treated as a slave, and when it rebelled, they punished it. |||| |||| Isaac Christians was born in Christiansboro, Virginia, a town founded by his ancestors. His life was full of regrets. As a child he accidentally pushed his brother Jeremiah off the roof to his death during a game. Stricken with guilt, Isaac built an emotional shell around himself, gradually emerging years later thanks to his friends, Elaine Willoughby and Buster Henderson; they called themselves the “Three Musketeers”, and while Buster was Isaac’s idol, Elaine was his first crush. When Buster became engaged to Elaine, Isaac was devastated. Soon after America entered the First World War; Buster swiftly signed up. Isaac followed soon after, but panicked when a sniper’s bullet killed a comrade on his first day in the trenches. Fleeing, Isaac ran into Buster, but soon saw him cut down by a hail of German gunfire while Isaac froze in terror. After the war Isaac abandoned his hometown and its memories. He traveled to Paris, where he became obsessed with Germaine, a prostitute bearing an uncanny resemblance to Elaine. Eventually, when she left him, Isaac resumed his travels, finally reaching Hyderabad, India, where for two years he became a follower of the holy man Vishnu Dass, gradually regaining his faith. His journey ended with a letter informing him his father had died; Isaac returned home to take on his familial responsibilities, spending decades as Christiansboro’s mayor until he retired. |||| |||| Increasingly upset at Christiansboro’s decline into poverty, Isaac read old books on magic, then summoned up Avarrish, one of the Six-Fingered Hand, who promised to save Christiansboro if Isaac would temporarily serve him. Agreeing, Isaac found himself in the body of the gargoyle, and was sent to kidnap Patsy Walker (Hellcat), nearly killing her housekeeper Dolly Donahue in the execution of this task. Isaac carried out a ceremony to make Patsy a demonic host; when her Defenders teammates arrived, he led a horde of demons against them, but because he tried to warn them off rather than slay them, Avarrish trapped him in the gargoyle body. After Hellcat was exorcised, the Defenders confronted the penitent Isaac; wishing to atone, he joined their ranks as Gargoyle, fighting other pawns of the Hand, including Dracula, Gordski and his undead legions, Asmodeus Jones, David Kessler and the Man-Thing, before finally confronting the true powers behind the group, an alliance of Hell Lords. Patsy, previously resentful towards him, finally forgave him in light of her own experiences during this battle, forging an enduring friendship; Isaac also became increasingly close to the recovered Dolly, finding their similar ages gave them much in common. |||| |||| Isaac remained with the Defenders, battling the Serpent-Men and attending the funeral of Captain Marvel, but became increasingly depressed by his perceived failure to save Christiansboro. Alongside the Defenders, he returned home to find the town full of ghostly apparitions. While Isaac was haunted by visions of his family, other specters overwhelmed the Defenders; fleeing the taunting ghosts, Isaac found his friends under attack from Null the Living Darkness, and used his own lifeforce to drive it off. The exhausted Gargoyle, near death, was saved by his family’s ghosts; having not been conjured by Null, they replenished him and informed him of their love, restoring his will to live. |||| |||| The next few months saw Isaac battle alongside the Defenders against the Secret Empire and the Enchantress, fight the Avengers as a pawn in the alien Supernalia’s feud against her estranged husband Nebulon, and travel to Earth-712 to free the Squadron Supreme from Null the Living Darkness’ new pawn, the Overmind. En route home, Isaac, Valkyrie, Beast and Namor took an extradimensional detour to the bizarre reality Here; dubbed “They” by the locals, the group obtained the Ruby Sneakers from the evil Lord Mayor Easy-Read the First to get home. While his relationship with Dolly slowly blossomed into love, Isaac took part in the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, joined other heroes in congratulating the Hulk on his pardon, and battled the Miracle Man after he stole the Son of Satan’s darksoul. Soon after Isaac attended the wedding of Daimon and Patsy, fighting agents of the Secret Empire who interrupted the nuptials. Following the Beast’s renovation of the team, the Defenders continued their vendetta with the Secret Empire and relocated to New Mexico. Magically kidnapped by an Afghan wizard for use as a familiar, Isaac was trapped within a pentagram-inscribed orb, until he tricked the wizard into coming to America, where the Defenders managed to free him. |||| |||| Drawn home by Elaine’s death, Isaac met the gargoyle’s spirit now wearing his old body. He allowed it to swap their forms, but the Gargoyle and its surviving fellows went on a rampage. Derwyddon, who had been tracking down the gargoyles, helped Isaac overcome his feelings of failure; after Derwyddon turned the other gargoyles to stone, Isaac reclaimed his demonic form, then slew his old body which again hosted the gargoyle’s spirit. During a subsequent visit to Dr. Strange’s house, Isaac was drawn to steal a crystal without knowing why; sometime later a possessed Moondragon ripped out Isaac’s soul and turned his gargoyle body into her pawn, warping it into an even more monstrous visage. Several of the Defenders, aided by the Interloper, sacrificed themselves, using their lifeforces to turn it, Moondragon and themselves to dust. |||| |||| Isaac’s unbound spirit entered the crystal he had taken from Strange’s sanctum, which was found by a soldier involved in the clean-up after the battle. Isaac controlled the soldier, tracking down Moondragon’s still active spirit, catching up with her when she made contact with her cousin Pamela Douglas. Moondragon convinced Isaac to accompany her and Pamela to Titan, where the Eternals grew Moondragon a new body. For his part, Isaac hung round Pamela’s neck, until she became Sundragon, using her new powers to give him a new body, capable of changing between human and gargoyle forms. While Moondragon returned to Earth, Isaac left for deep space with Sundragon, Cloud and the Titanian Eternal Demeityr, but was captured by the Stranger. Eventually Isaac escaped the Stranger’s Lab World with many of the other inmates and returned to Earth. |||| |||| Isaac sought out Dolly, resuming their relationship, but after she died of old age he moved in with Patsy and Daimon Hellstrom at their mansion at Fire Lake, Massachusetts. Having lost his darksoul Daimon began to die; Patsy worked with Isaac to summon “Satan” to help his son, but the sight of Daimon’s true, demonic face drove Patsy insane. Isaac stayed on to care for Patsy, and tried to keep Daimon from straying too far. Even after Patsy’s suicide, and disapproving of Daimon’s new consort, Jaine Cutter, Isaac felt he had nowhere else to go. He eventually managed to stop viewing Jaine as Patsy’s replacement, and they became friends. |||| Isaac later returned to Christiansboro, summoned by the sorceress Seetah, who sent him to find the Silver Surfer, but en route he was taken over by the Coroner. Overpowered and freed by the Surfer, they confronted the Coroner, who turned Isaac to stone; Seetah later made him flesh again, informing him he still had a quest to fulfill. It is unclear whether he has completed this quest or not, but he was recently seen back at Fire Lake when the Thunderbolts visited."

While in prison at Ryer’s Island, he met and befriended Dirk Garthwaite, a.k.a. the Wrecker. The Wrecker told his friends of the power he received by Karnilla, the Norn Queen, power enough to take on the thunder god Thor, and they orchestrated an escape. With fellow convicts Dr. Eliot Franklin and Henry Camp, the four managed to retrieve the crowbar that housed the powers that had been drained from the Wrecker. Grasping the bar in an electrical storm, the Wrecker was restored, Franklin became Thunderball, Camp became Bulldozer, and Calusky became Piledriver. Together, they became known as the Wrecking Crew. |||| After their first foray against the Defenders, Piledriver and the Wrecking Crew were inseparable, appearing with them in all their endeavors, including their abduction to Battleworld by the Beyonder and joining with Doctor Doom's army of super-villains. The Crew also joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and Piledriver was instrumental in helping bring down Hercules. After this, Thor used his hammer to draw the Wrecker’s away from the others who divided it, and Piledriver was left powerless. |||| |||| Months later, the Wrecker freed his Crew and restored their power once more. As before, wherever the Wrecking Crew was to be found, Piledriver was among their number. They performed many other acts of villainy, although they had to deal often with the treachery of Thunderball, who craved the Wrecker’s power all for himself. Eventually, the Crew reconciled, seeking out Hercules once more. But battling them helped Hercules overcome the fear of combat he had suffered since the beating at their hands, and they were defeated. |||| |||| Once, their powers began fading when many of Asgard's links to Earth were separated.

They defeated the Crew and presumably allowed Excavator to be reunited with his family guardians."

With every being encountered, Amazo becomes even more powerful and virtually unstoppable. Originally, he could only use one power at a time and has duplicated Superman's strength, The Flash's speed, Green Lantern's power ring, and Wonder Woman's magic lasso among others. In most cases, Amazo possesses a 'default' form consisting of the powers of the first five (post-Crisis) JLA members, capable of adapting to incorporate other powers. After years of battling the JLA to a standstill, he recently 'upgraded' by absorbing part of Hourman's Worlogog which gave him time traveling powers as well. |||| |||| Power Amplification: The ability to absorb others' powers and magnify them to greater levels.","Credited as being the world's first official android, Amazo was created by the immortal, evil mastermind Professor Ivo. Utilizing superior 'absorption cell' technology, Amazo can replicate the super powers of any metahuman he encounters. And so, Amazo became one of the most dangerous menaces to originally oppose the Justice League of America. While initially programmed to serve the agenda of his creator - to find any means to prolong Ivo's immortality, Amazo had outgrown his original agenda. |||| |||| Taking on the Justice League of America, Amazo has several heroic enemies. For a time, he was imprisoned in an airtight chamber within The Fortress of Solitude, after challenging Superman. However, he eventually escaped that prison, and resumed his rivalry with the JLA, as well as the Justice Legion A's Hourman. A cybernetic hero from the 853rd century, Hourman's presence made Amazo resentful and bitter. But while Hourman - who later joined the new JSA, then departed to his original time period, is no longer Amazo's primary foe, Superman and the rest of the Justice League were still present to pose a continual problem for Amazo. While his programming and own sentience have displayed no intent on world conquest, Amazo exists as a monster of sorts, whose very being is a hazard to all of humanity.",None entered.

3248,Electro (Marvel)(Ultimate),Dillon ,3248_20070906053804_char.jpg,Electro can generate and re-channel electric energy into concussive force.,,"Dillon was a criminal who underwent illegal genetic experiments carried out by Dr. John Skrtic on behalf of industrialist Justin Hammer, who was competing with Osborn Industries to win a lucrative government contract to create a super-soldier serum. Having been successfully given electrical abilities, Electro, as he now liked to be called, was sold into the service of the Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk, in return for construction contracts for another of Hammer’s projects. Electro served Fisk willingly as an enforcer, and when Spider-Man broke into Fisk Tower, the Kingpin set his new acquisition the task of taking the intruder down, something Electro swiftly managed. Electro was subsequently present when Kingpin murdered Frederick Foswell, the underboss known as Mr. Big, for having supplied Spider-Man with information. |||| |||| |||| When Spider-Man returned to the Tower a few days later to steal the surveillance footage showing Fisk’s crime, Electro and the Enforcers were sent to stop him. Initially dodging Electro’s blasts, Spider-Man then tricked his foe into stunning Ox, one of the Enforcers. After taking down the other two Enforcers, Spider-Man grappled with Electro, then threw him in to a stream of water coming from a broken water pipe, causing the electrical criminal to short out violently. |||| |||| He awoke three weeks later in hospital to find that the Kingpin had fled the country and F.B.I. agents waiting for him to wake so they could question him as to his reasons for being in the crime lord’s basement. Electro’s killed everyone in the room and fled, but he was swiftly recaptured by Captain America, Iron Man and the Black Widow. He was imprisoned in a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. facility alongside several other genetically modified criminals (Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Kraven and Sandman), his powers blocked by a high-tech control collar, to be studied and interrogated by Hank Pym (Giant Man). After several months, Dr Octopus engineered a break out, and the group slaughtered their way to freedom, killing 35 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on their way out. Their next move was a direct assault on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Triskelion main base to capture Spider-Man, who had been moved there for his own protection. Octopus breached computer security to shut down the base’s defenses, then Electro overloaded both primary and back-up generators. The group entered and left equally swiftly with their objective. |||| |||| Spider-Man was coerced into working with them on as they launched an attack on the White House itself. Conventional forces fell before them in seconds, but their progress was halted on the front lawn outside the Oval Office by the arrival of the Ultimates. Electro attacked Thor, and their battle raged into the air; but Electro’s powers proved no match for the alleged God of Lightning, who soon won the day, and along with his teammates, Electro was returned to custody. |||| Bolivar Trask hired Electro to test Eddie Brock and the Venom suit by leading him on a chase through Manhattan. Spider-man showed up, but was knocked unconscious, resulting in a battle between Venom and Electro for the life of the web-slinger. Although Venom defeated Electro, S.H.I.E.L.D. intervened before anything more could happen. Electro was then placed back into their custody."

Due to being blind, she is capable of sensing things other people can't, such as another's heartbeat or general presence",,"The laboratory explosion which blinded young Alicia Masters for life also killed her father. Her mother married her father's partner, the man who would eventually become the Puppet Master. After her mother died, Phillip Masters raised Alicia alone. |||| |||| |||| When her stepfather used his abilities to control the Fantastic Four's Thing and bring him to his apartment for revenge, Alicia sensed the presence of the Invisible Girl, allowing the Puppet Master to trap her by flooding the room with ether. With the Invisible Girl captured, her stepfather dressed Alicia up to look like her and sent her with the Thing to the Baxter Building. But when the Thing attacked his teammates, the rest of the Fantastic Four lured him into a serum that Mister Fantastic had designed to return him to his human self, which broke the Puppet Master’s control. Alicia ran to Ben, and felt his face, but though it radiated the same strength and kindness he did as the Thing, she was relieved when he quickly transformed back into his, tragic and sensitive, rocky self. |||| |||| |||| Alicia was left alone in their apartment after the Fantastic Four defeated her stepfather; afraid that he would return and force her to do things she didn’t want to. He did return, and revealed to her a puppet of himself in a king’s crown and robe. He announced that he would control the world with his puppets. But she resisted him, and in a struggle she tipped over his puppet, pushing him out of a window, seemingly to his death. Her stepfather’s apparent death was short-lived, however, and soon he returned to plague the Fantastic Four, and Alicia, for many years. Alicia quickly befriended the Thing, and they soon began a romantic relationship that also lasted many years. |||| |||| |||| When the Silver Surfer first led Galactus to Earth, the Surfer was struck temporarily unconscious by blow from the Thing. Alicia took care of the Surfer, who was touched by her compassion. This meeting with Alicia led the Surfer to realize the worth of the human race, and to betray Galactus in their defense. He later returned to her but their friendship didn't last long, as the Thing grew jealous and fought with him, believing the Surfer would win Alicia away from him. |||| |||| |||| Alicia was later kidnapped by the Enclave in order to use her blindness and skills as a sculptress to sculpt a bust of their creation, Him, as he initially gave off too much light for a sighted person to withstand. Alicia followed Dr. Hamilton into Warlock's cell, but Warlock sensed her goodness and allowed her in while he imprisoned Hamilton in living vines. She was the first person to see Warlock emerge from the cocoon which his body had surrounded him in, and was forced to stand by while he killed Hamilton and tore apart the Beehive. But the Fantastic Four soon saved her and teleported her out with them before Warlock could transport himself, as well, destroying the Beehive and killing his creators. |||| |||| |||| Over time, Alicia and Ben's relationship grew stronger, and the two considered marriage several times. However, Ben's membership in the Fantastic Four continued to put Alicia at risk and she was occasionally kidnapped or used against Ben, most notably when she mutated into a spider-monster at the hands of Hydra and she was transformed into the Egyptian bride of Nephrus. When Alicia was hospitalized after a brutal attack by Annihilus, their relationship grew troubled. Each came to the conclusion that their courtship should end, but before they could act on it, Ben was taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld and Alicia was kidnapped by Skrulls. One of the Skulls, Lyja the Lazerfirst, took Alicia's place and masqueraded as her for a long period time, starting a romance with and eventually marrying the Human Torch. When the Fantastic Four eventually rescued the real Alicia, she and Ben officially and amicably ended their romance, though they remain good friends. Her father has twice tried to manipulate their minds to reunite the pair, in Liddleville and Sunshine City, but both efforts failed. |||| |||| |||| Recently, Alicia traveled into space with Silver Surfer. To preserve her life while off planet, the alien robot Cy-phyrr 4 gifted her a suit of armor which gave her 'quantum slight' and allowed her to manipulate cosmic energy. Alicia later permanently sacrificed her armor to save the lives of Mantis and several bystanders when Galactus attempted to devour the Shi'ar homeworld. During this time, Alicia and the Surfer conducted a romantic relationship, which ended when Alicia decided to remain on Earth while Surfer wanted to return to the stars. Alicia has since returned to her career as a successful sculptor."

He has absolute control over magnetism and shows often startling prowess at manipulating all things metallic in a way that casual comic fans might today recognize as a kind of riff on the X-Men villain, Magneto.  In truth, though, this hero predates the Marvel villain by about a decade. As one of the longest-running members of the Legion, and its frequent leader, his is one of the more developed personalities. Though his personality has fluctuated in each of the major runs of the book, he is characterized with some variation, but he never strays too far from being portrayed as an essentially serious leader--a 'straight', earnest, mature figure amongst his more frivolous peers. He is frequently shown to be in an adversarial relationship with Braniac 5. He often displays fraternal respect to Lightning Lad/Live WIre and Saturn Girl. These four may be seen to be the solid leadership core of the group. He has maintained various romantic relationships, but perhaps none as significant as that to the Legion of Substitute Superheroes' Night Lass."
202,Jack of Hearts (Marvel),Jonathan 'Jack' Hart ,202_20061220213110_char.jpg,"Jack was able to generate bursts of energy in the form of concussive force, intense heat, or propelling force that enabled him to fly. He was also capable of absorbing energy from other sources. He possessed superhuman levels of healing and endurance and could survive unprotected in space. Although he only had normal intelligence, his thinking capacity was enhanced by a scanning device which gave his thought processes the speed and efficiency of a highly advanced computer. Jack also had superhuman strength.",,"Born to a scientist father and an extraterrestrial mother, Jack Hart unknowingly developed energy abilities that threatened to consume him. His father, concealing the truth from him, developed a radioactive inhibitor called Zero Fluid, which he claimed was a new form of fuel. When Philip was slain by agents of the criminal Corporation, Jack was accidentally doused with Zero Fluid, which served as a catalyst to activate his energy powers under limited control. Developing armor to contain his energies and calling himself the Jack of Hearts (in honor of his father's love for playing cards) Jack set out to avenge his father's death. This initially brought him into conflict with several heroes including the White Tiger. After slaying his father’s murderer, Jack was taken under the wing of Iron Man and became active as a hero. When he began losing control of his power level, he turned himself in to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he was isolated and trained. |||| |||| Jack subsequently learned of his alien heritage and traveled to his mother's homeworld, Contraxia, where he re-energized the planet's dying sun. Unwilling to return to Earth, Jack remained in space for a while and was briefly captured by the Stranger and held prisoner on his Laboratory World. The Laboratory World prisoners were set free during an invasion by the Overmind and the Squadron Supreme, and Jack went back to Earth. Upon his return to Earth, Jack battled Quasar and fellow escapees the Presence and Starlight, and the Presence blew a hole in Jack's suit, causing him to retreat into space. Moondragon retrieved him from space, revived him, and mentally forced him to battle Kismet. After he escaped Moondragon's control, Jack set out for space again. |||| |||| Jack sought out the Silver Surfer‘s aid in controlling his powers and Jack received an improved set of alien armor on the Anvil prison planet where he helped the Surfer battle Nebula and Gaetar. A short time later, he was captured by the powerful Tyrant along with Thor‘s oath-brother Beta Ray Bill, the leader of the Imperial Guard, Gladiator, alien warrior woman Ganymede, and former Heralds of Galactus, the Silver Surfer, Terrax, and Morg (the latter of which was Galactus' Herald at the time). All except Morg managed to escape from Tyrant, and Jack became a close ally and lover of Ganymede. |||| |||| Later, Jack encountered a group of Avengers in space and was involved in a conflict between the Avengers and the Infinites. Jack accompanied them back to Earth, coming into conflict with the alien Ruul (who were secretly just a mutated faction of the Kree) when they plotted to turn the Earth into a prison planet for inter-galactic criminals. After this conflict, he accepted the invitation to join the Avengers. Unfortunately, remaining on Earth required him to subject himself again to periodic isolation, this time for fourteen hours a day. Growing tired of such restraints, Jack allowed himself to explode due to a buildup of his energy, but not before saving Ant-Man‘s daughter Cassandra Lang from a child-killer. He was believed to be dead for a time but apparently returned when the Scarlet Witch went insane (though his zombie-like form might have been an apparition created by the Witch) and his body exploded again, killing Scott Lang in front of the Avengers' Mansion."
644,Molecule Man (Marvel),Owen Reece ,644_20071006051739_char.jpg,"Owen Reece has the phenomenal ability to control all matter on a molecular level. His typical uses for this power has been to mold matter to his whim, disrupt matter into dust or liquid, and convert one substance into another. He also uses the power to fly and control complex machines. The full range of Reece's power remains unknown, but he was able with the help of the Silver Surfer to affect the Earth on a planet-wide scale. Originally, he limited himself to being able to affect only inorganic materials, but there truly seems to be no limit to his power. Once, he proved able to store his life force in his wand, then mentally take over anyone who handled it, even creating a new body for himself.",,"The Molecule Man started out as a lowly laboratory technician who worked at the Acme Atomic Corp. But one day, while Owen Reece was bemoaning his position in life as a nobody, a cog in the wheels of the corporation, he became distracted enough to make a mistake that would forever change his life. The atomic machine he worked on blasted him with radiation, and he survived, but the accident gave him power over the very building blocks of existence. Without even knowing his name, the head of the corporation fired him, but Owen used his newfound powers to freeze him solid, using a wand that he believed he needed to focus his powers. |||| |||| Reece then took control of the Fantastic Four’s Baxter Building, and tore it from the ground, hovering along with it over Times Square. He announced that he was taking over the city would become the only law. Even the Fantastic Four, who were asked to stop him by Uatu The Watcher, were unable to beat him, and were forced to flee in order to come up with a new plan. But Mister Fantastic soon discovered that Reece could seemingly not control organic material and enlisted the help of Alicia Masters, the Thing’s girlfriend, to cover the four in plaster and pass them off as statues. Reece came after them and tried to manipulate the statues, but the feedback from trying to affect their organic molecules caused him intense pain. Uatu then appeared and trapped him within another dimension to protect Earth from his power. |||| |||| To pass the time, Owen created a companion, using his powers to fashion a fully-conscious being that he called his son. However, Owen found that time passed at an accelerated rate in his new world and soon died of old age. Owen’s “son” took up the Molecule Man’s wand and found it contained all his power. Calling himself the new Molecule Man, the being used the wand to escape back to Earth, hoping to avenge his father. He sought out the Thing of the Fantastic Four, battling him until the Thing managed to separate him from the wand. Apparently, the wand was necessary to maintain his existence, and the new Molecule Man disintegrated. |||| |||| In fact, Owen Reece had not died, but managed to transfer his consciousness and powers into the wand his 'son' carried. He could overpower the minds of whoever touched the wand and take control of their bodies, temporarily reviving the Molecule Man each time. The wand passed through the hands of a succession of holders until the Silver Surfer happened upon it, sensing its great power. When he casually dismissed it, however, Reece's mind finally proved able to recreate his body, power and all. His encounter with the Surfer convinced Owen that he had always failed because he had no purpose beyond petty tantrums. Inspired by the Surfer’s tale, Owen decided he would devour the Earth similar to Galactus. The Surfer sent for help, and the Avengers arrived to confront him. The Avengers were easily defeated, as the Molecule Man disintegrated Captain America’s shield, Iron Man’s armor, Thor’s hammer, and even the Silver Surfer’s surfboard. Ultimately, it was Tigra who managed to talk him down, giving Owen the first heart-to-heart he had heard in years and convincing him to give himself up and seek psychiatric help. |||| |||| Owen Reece did so, and soon began seek out more conventional goals: true love, friendship, and a good home. Instead, however, the Molecule Man was abducted to Battleworld, the planet created by the Beyonder (now, the Maker), as part of the small army of criminal superhuman beings that were to engage in the first of the Secret Wars. He only joined the other supervillains after some persuasive words by Doctor Doom, and fought the assembled superheroes who were also brought to Battleworld. During the course of the war, Owen and Volcana fell in love. When Doom succeeded in stealing the power of the Beyonder for himself, Owen thought Doom had abandoned them all and confronted Doom, threatening to kill him. But Doom helped Reece realize his powers were only limited by his own sense of unworthiness--his power was greater than he had believed and could even effect organic materials. No longer angry at Doom (who eventually lost his new power), Owen used his powers to transport himself, Volcana, and most of the criminals, along with the entire portion of the city of Denver, back to Earth. |||| |||| On Earth, Owen and Volcana began a quiet life living together, and Owen took a new job as a worker in an atomic plant. This bliss was not to last, as the Beyonder returned to Earth to seek emotional fulfillment but failed, declaring he would destroy the multiverse. Owen was sought out by the assembled heroes, and he tried to destroy the Beyonder, but the Beyonder's immense power far surpassed even Owen’s own, and Owen was left exhausted. Finally, the Beyonder unleashed an immensely powerful blast of energy to destroy Owen and his allies, sufficient even to rip open Earth's crust and threaten incredible planetwide instability. The Molecule Man used his power to shield himself and his allies and remove every living thing from the path of the blast to safety, but the cost of doing so seemed to severely injure him internally. |||| |||| The Beyonder then created a complex machine to transform himself into a mortal being with his full power. The Molecule Man and his allies found the machine, and Owen, but they could not take the chance that the newly reborn Beyonder would not someday destroy the multiverse, and decided to kill him while he was incubating. Owen wrecked the machine, causing the infant's death, and diverted the Beyonder's immense power, released by the machine, into the dimension from which the Beyonder had originally come. The injured Molecule Man and the Silver Surfer, uniting their power temporarily, repaired all the damage done to the Earth. Owen then claimed his powers had been burned out, so as to once more hide away from the heroes. He returned to live quietly with Volcana in their Denver suburb. Among his allies, only Volcana and the Silver Surfer knew that Owen still had his powers. |||| |||| Months later, Owen was confronted by Kubik, a being created from the Cosmic Cube. Kubik revealed to Owen that his powers stemmed from similar energies, as did the Beyonder, who Kubik also confronted and nearly destroyed most of the Beyonder's pet reality. Kubik might have destroyed the Beyonder, but the alien Shaper of Worlds called him to stop the battle. Under the Shaper's guidance, Kubik, Molecule Man, and the Beyonder realized they shared a common origin, and the Molecule Man and Beyonder physically merged to create a new Cosmic Cube-- their powers were actually an intelligence like Kubik's that was split during the Molecule Man's origin. Owen was mutated into the Molecule Man while the remaining energy developed sentience to become the Beyonder. Kubik left with the Shaper into space to oversee the development of this new Cube, which might someday hatch a being similar to Kubik. |||| |||| Volcana, who believed Owen to be dead after merging into the Cube, was actually secretly imbued by Owen with his power moments before the transformation. She tried going through life as normal, but soon found herself exhibiting strange new aspects of her powers, due to the power of the Molecule Man within her. |||| Eventually, the Cube separated Owen’s essence from his power, rejected him and returned him to Earth, powerless. Volcana soon stumbled upon Owen, who was living in squalor at his old apartment. He knew he was powerless and felt it better to live in anonymity than to have nothing to offer his true love. Before they could make up, the criminal organization A.I.M., which had been tracking Volcana due to her power fluctuations, attacked the two through their agent Klaw. Reece's powers, within her, evolved to allow her to wish his powers returned to him. Now once again the Molecule Man, Owen quickly defeated Klaw, but Volcana would not return to him, seeing him as a bully and too dependant on his power to attempt to try a relationship. Owen left her, still professing his love and vowing to prove it to her someday."

She went from being a fairly bland (read: safe) version of herself that really had a lot in common with the animated Super Friends version.  She was all about super powers and kickin' ass, with just a pinch of her Amazonian legacy thrown in.  By the early-mid 70s, though, she had abandoned the uniform and powers entirely, and adopted a role much closer to a secret agent.  She studied with a martial arts expert, took a job as the proprietor of a hip clothing store, and wasn't seen for a couple of years in her Wonder Woman outfit.  This era drew criticism, though, so she regained her powers and went on a 2-year quest to be returned to active duty in the JLA.  No sooner had she endured her trials when the Wonder Woman title started telling Earth 2 Wonder Woman stories, in deference to the setting of the Wonder Woman TV show.  When the show, in its later seasons, returned to the present, the comic returned to Earth 1, and the newly-JLA-reinstated Wonder Woman. |||| |||| During the Crisis , Diana was thought to have been killed.  However, as the Pérez run would make clear, she hadn't been killed, but sent back in time. |||| |||| And this , out of all of Wonder Woman's adventures, is where it gets weird. |||| |||| Somehow, in a way not adequately explained, she wasn't just thrown back in time.  She was actually devolved to the day she'd been formed of clay.  In other words, the Crisis affected her in a way substantially differently than it did any other character in the DCU.  Wonder Woman II and Wonder Woman III are the same person, but neither has knowledge of the other.  We speak of 'reboots' frequently in assessing the history of comic books, but it's never been so literally true as perhaps it was with Wonder Woman. |||| |||| What's unfortunate about this method of reinventing the character is that, far from making her history 'simpler', as was the intended effect of the Crisis , it makes it much more complicated.  Had she been a part of the normal 'Crisis effect'--that is, had she been reset precisely as the rest of the DCU--her story would've just started at whatever point the writers wanted to set. But in drawing this link between pre- and post- Crisis Diana, and in demonstrating that she actually 'devolved' from one to the other, she confusingly becomes a 'non-surviving survivor' of Crisis on Infinite Earths . |||| For a discussion of this character's costume evolution, please click here"

Like all Asgardians, he possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. |||| |||| Fandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his superhuman dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. Thor himself refers to Fandral as 'the best of us with the blade'.  Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength. |||| |||| Fandral rides a horse named Firehooves. He can also use the Asgardian Starjammer for transportation.",,"Fandral is a warrior of Asgard and an adventurer. He is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perennially pointed out by the gloomy Hogun. Fandral considers himself the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies. His actual success with these ladies is intermittent at best, but as such provides numerous opportunities for humorous results. Despite these flaws, he possesses an excessively noble spirit and will do the right thing without thought to his personal safety or prosperity. |||| |||| Fandral seemingly perishes early on in the final battle of Ragnarok. Others who have perished in the same battle, such as Heimdall, have been found alive and well on Earth."

Almost a century old, he has the appearance of a man roughly half his age and the vitality of one even younger.",,"Born in the late 1910s, Harvey Elder possessed a genius intellect but was shunned because of his homely appearance. Hearing rumors of an underground kingdom where he might find acceptance or at least solitude, Elder spent years searching the globe for it, without success. In 1956, he tried to join the Explorers Club on the basis of his exploits, but he was disbelieved and ridiculed. Fuming, he chanced to observe a gathering of adventurers by the Eternal Makkari, who sought a team of Monster Hunters to aid him against the Deviant Kro and his monstrous Mutates; believing the group's efforts would lead them to his subterranean goal, Elder stowed away on their plane and was separated from the heroes in the course of the battle. |||| |||| Washing up on the shores of Monster Island, he explored a series of caverns until he at last discovered Subterranea, a network of tunnels running beneath the surface of much of the Earth; however, he was caught in an earthquake and almost blinded in the mysterious Valley of Diamonds. Undaunted, Elder explored the vastness of Subterranea and carved out a kingdom of his own. His early activities may have influenced various subterranean monster incursions that plagued the U.S. and other nations during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He discovered and mastered Deviant technology, proving himself a rival to the underground reigns of the monstrous Two-Headed Thing and the immortal Tyrannus, and later fighting Spragg the Living Hill. Slowing his own aging through unknown means, the Mole Man eventually won rulership of the so-called Moloid race, docile servants abandoned by the Deviants, as well as of many of the Mutates once used for conquest or sport by their former masters. |||| |||| In recent years, having achieved a satisfactory power base, the Mole Man launched his first known attack on the surface world, dispatching his Mutates to destroy power plants in preparation for an all-out invasion; however, his campaign had only begun when he attracted the attention of the newly-formed Fantastic Four, who entered Subterranea via its Monster Island entrance and defeated the Mole Man and his monsters, destroying the entrance in the process. Regrouping, he led the Fantastic Four into a trap while he prepared to continue his assault on humanity by sinking entire cities, but was again defeated. He next sank buildings in New York City, successfully taking the Invisible Girl hostage to prevent the Fantastic Four from opposing his intended world conquest; the Fantastic Four rescued her, though she suffered a head injury and was only saved by emergency surgery. |||| |||| He was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to attack Reed and Sue's wedding. He burst through the floor with his Moloids, but was driven back when Professor X called his X-Men to fight them, along with the Thing's help. |||| |||| The Mole Man subsequently battled the Avengers, both alongside the communist Red Ghost and assisted by his giant Minotaur. A closer enemy was his rival Tyrannus, who ruled a second servant race, the Tyrannoids, and sought the Mole Man's territory for himself. Both underground rulers used surface heroes, such as the Hulk and X-Men, as pawns in their war, but the Mole Man soon turned his dimmed eyes back to conquest; he sought to blind humanity as he imagined it had been blinded to his accomplishments. Mistakenly assuming Project: Earthdig, intended to bury nuclear waste deep within the planet, was an assault on him, the Mole Man joined forces with Dr. Erik Gorbo (the Monster-Ape) against Captain America and plotted another surface assault before learning the truth. The Mole Man formed an alliance with the Netherworld's Queen Kala, whom he hoped to romance, and even managed to enslave Tyrannus; but Kala ultimately betrayed him to Tyrannus, who betrayed her in turn, leaving the Fantastic Four to triumph over the trio. |||| |||| Seeking to spare others the scorn he had suffered, the Mole Man united his old and new worlds by welcoming some of surface society's rejects into Subterranea as his Outcasts, empowering four of them - Boulder, Digger, Landslide, and Water Witch - as Super-Outcasts. When Kala led the fiery Lava Men in an attack on his kingdom to regain access to the Fountain of Youth, the Mole Man agreed to a contest between his Outcasts and her operatives, Olympic athletes whom she granted high-tech weaponry and forced to assist her. The conflict drew the Hulk and Spider-Man into the fray, fighting for Kala and the Mole Man, respectively. Kala failed and was abandoned by her army, but the Mole Man took pity upon her and renewed their relationship. His struggles continued against the likes of the Galadorian Spaceknight ROM and the alien Dire Wraiths, as well as Heroes for Hire Power Man (Luke Cage) and Iron Fist. Mellowing somewhat, he soon took Tyrannus' abandoned Tyrannoids under his wing as well. He and Kala ruled peacefully until would-be Messiah Alden Maas, in his mad attempt to expand the Earth, unleashed magma flows in Subterranea, killing many of its inhabitants. Abandoned by Kala and half-mad with grief and rage, the Mole Man sought to raise a new continent for his people, regardless of the devastation such a tectonic shift would cause. The Thing briefly joined the Outcasts during a period of extreme depression, befriending the Mole Man and remaining unaware of his secret agenda, but he left with the Fantastic Four after learning the truth. Lost in holographic illusions of the surface society that had rejected him so long ago, the Mole Man barely noticed when the Fantastic Four halted the tectonic procedure, burying him and his equipment beneath tons of rock. |||| |||| Months later, having regained his sanity, the Mole Man decided it was time for peace with the surface world, only to be attacked by Fantastic Four clones created by Aron the Rogue Watcher, renewing his desire for war. Following an encounter with the Skrull De'Lila and the replacement Fantastic Four - Ghost Rider, Hulk, Spider-Man, and Wolverine - he found his Moloids and Tyrannoids under attack by the Lava Men, all of whom had been attacked in his absence and partially sterilized by the High Evolutionary's forces; with the Fantastic Four's help, he put an end to the hostilities and eventually united the tribes under his rule. During a battle with old foe Spragg, he sought to claim She-Hulk as his bride, but was instead briefly turned into an actual mole. When the Deviants began to exert their power in Subterranea once more, he protected his domain alongside the returned Tyrannus and Grotesk, last survivor of the Gor-Tokians, yet another underground race. Disaster was averted by the Avengers, and Kala returned to the Mole Man's side as his fiancée. Hoping to win more allies, he offered Monster Island as sanctuary to the misfit heroes of the short-lived Infinity Watch, but an immense tidal wave caused him to withdraw from Monster Island, severing his ties with the Watch. |||| When the Fantastic Four and other heroes vanished during the Onslaught crisis, the Mole Man, evidently bored by protracted peace, laid plans for yet another invasion; but when word of the heroes' return reached him, he chose practicality over ego and abandoned the effort. The long-suffering Moloids faced yet another crisis when they were absorbed into a host body for the alien Terminus, but the Mole Man freed his subjects through cooperation with the Fantastic Four, who defeated Terminus. The Mole Man subsequently stole a sewage treatment plant to save his Moloids, sensitized during recent exposure to the surface world, from pollution trickling into his domain. After years of failed conquest attempts, the Mole Man established an uneasy neutrality with the Fantastic Four and other surface heroes, providing occasional aid when it suited his interests and fighting them only out of misunderstanding or manipulation. Kala's seeming disappearance from his side may foretell further upheavals within the Subterranean nations. Recently, however, using a sample of his DNA obtained during an aborted plot of the Mad Thinker, the Fantastic Four ambushed and captured the Mole Man, placing him in stasis aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier as part of their efforts to preemptively imprison all of their foes."

Eventually he noticed that many of the contortionists liked a particular soft drink called Gingold. He isolated the key ingredient—the juice of a little-known tropical fruit called the gingo—and distilled it. By drinking this gingold extract, Dibny gained the ability to stretch any part of his body to fantastic lengths. |||| |||| Recently, Sue was tragically killed in the couple’s Opal City home. In his grief, Ralph has quit drinking Gingold and given up his powers. He is investigating a resurrection cult, and the mystery of the Helmet of Fate."

She can project heat waves, fire blasts and flame constructs; create powerful winds by manipulating air temperatures; use convection currents and thermal updrafts to carry tremendous weights aloft; and fly fast enough to achieve escape velocity. She can mentally control any heat or flame in her vicinity, and is physically immune to extreme heat and fire. Firebird has also displayed more mysterious, possibly mystical abilities. She sometimes has visions, can sense the presence of evil (especially supernatural evil), has uncanny intuition, and seems immune to demonic possession. Most remarkably, Bonita may be immortal, having proven miraculously immune to potentially fatal conditions such as the vacuum of space, a universal poison (powerful enough to kill even the Silver Surfer) and massive radiation. The Collector believes she may be one of the few beings in the universe who cannot die.",,"A devout Catholic social worker of Mexican ancestry, Bonita Juarez was wandering her beloved desert outside Albuquerque when a fiery meteor struck mere feet away from her. Miraculously unharmed, Bonita discovered she now had supernatural power over flame, which she used days later to foil a convenience store robbery. Described as 'Pajaro Del Fuego' by one of the robbers, Juarez took the costumed alias Firebird and protected the American Southwest, both alone and as a member of the short-lived Rangers team. Later, after she was attacked by the demonic Master Pandemonium, Bonita tracked and fought him alongside the new western Avengers roster. Eager to join their ranks, Bonita aided them against other foes such as the Werewolf and the Cat People, but team leader Hawkeye passed over her in favor of the Thing. Firebird's subsequent attempt to revive the Rangers was a failure (though she did succeed in exposing the demonic possession of her old teammate Shooting Star), and she soon left on a spiritual retreat. |||| |||| |||| Returning in a more overtly religious guise as Espirita, Bonita helped a suicidally depressed Hank Pym rebuild his life, sharing a brief romance with him. She also helped rescue the western Avengers from Dominus' time travel trap, using a message from Hawkeye entrusted to her family over two hundred years earlier. She later met SHIELD (the Society of Higher Interstellar Education and Logistical Development), a group of alien scholars who claimed the meteor that empowered her was waste material from one of their failed experiments. Bonita accepted the revelation as a lesson in humility, comforting herself with the belief that God might still be the author of her powers, albeit more indirectly than she had first imagined. |||| |||| |||| Resuming her original alias as Firebird, she returned to her career as a social worker and became an Avengers reservist, aiding the team against various foes such as the Awesome Android, the Acts of Vengeance conspiracy, Atlantean invaders, SURF, Morgan le Fay and Dominex, and helping monitor the captured Bloodwraith and an alien invasion of Madripoor. She has declined several offers of full-time Avengers membership as she is devoted to her church work, but she did temporarily join the active roster for the duration of the Kang Dynasty war, helping liberate Earth and successfully counselling a disillusioned Thor. ||||"

These cables, which eject and retract from special appliances running from shoulder to wrist, are made of an Adamantium alloy (Adamantium being the strongest metal forged by man). Able to extend a maximum length of 30 feet, the Adamantium cables can be used as whips, capable of rending steel and lesser metals; or as bonds, capable of entwining an object or human being and constricting with a maximum force of 115 pounds per square inch. Once securely around an object or human being the cables are unbreakable.

He can cyboernetically control the amount of voltage he channels through each cable. |||| |||| The cybernetic circuitry controlling the functions of the functions of the cables is located in the forehead area of his cowl. The circuitry housing is bullet-proofed and insulated against most forms of jamming radiations.",,"Frank Payne was presumably a child of divorced parents, as he was raised by a single, if abusive, father. Payne grew up to become an agent for the international espionage organization S.H.I.E.L.D.. Payne was working deep undercover as Frank Schlichting, a small-time hoodlum and enforcer for the Chicago-area mobs. After an incident where he was forced to shoot several of members of a rival gang, Payne snapped. He went to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s director, Nick Fury, to ask to be taken off of the case. However, Fury forced him to go back. Days later, an infuriated and fed-up Payne dropped all contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. |||| |||| Despite his previous aversion to killing, Frank, now Frank Schlichting, next appeared on the West Coast to make a name for himself as a criminal mercenary. Applying to Eugene Kligger of the now-defunct criminal organization known as the Corporation, Schlichting was outfitted with the armor, equipment, and identity of the Constrictor and became their special operative and hit man. |||| |||| His first public mission brought him into conflict with the Hulk, but the Corporation soon dissolved and left the Constrictor as a freelance criminal. He then ran afoul of Captain America. He sought employment from the criminal financier Justin Hammer and was ordered alongside other hired criminals to take out Iron Man, but he was unsuccessful. He next teamed up with Sabretooth in a partnership, but the two were thwarted by Luke Cage and Iron Fist. The Constrictor was invited to join the criminal organization, the Serpent Society, at one point, but he refused, and he embarked on several solo criminal activities, which were stopped by the likes of Captain America and Spider-Man. |||| |||| The Constrictor joined another group, the Masters of Evil, under the leadership of the latest Crimson Cowl. The Masters sought to pool their resources from various crimes, and soon tried their hands at a worldwide blackmail scheme, but they were all defeated by the Thunderbolts. |||| |||| More recently, the villain Sabretooth was left for dead when his Adamantium-laced skeleton was ripped from his body by the villain Apocalypse. The Constrictor was forced by the hero Gambit to give up his coils to save Sabretooth's life, although Frank soon obtained his current Vibranium models. |||| |||| The Constrictor briefly shared an apartment with two other villains, Titania (actually Copycat in disguise) and Deadpool. During a rare moment of camaraderie, he revealed that he had a daughter by the name of Mia Payne, although she remains unaware of her father's career as the Constrictor. (Nick Fury had told Payne's family that Payne, whose cover had been as a business executive, had died in a plane crash.) |||| |||| Recently, the Constrictor has come into a large amount of money. During an armed hijacking, he and fellow villains Jack O'Lantern and the Armadillo were thwarted by Hercules, who left the Constrictor seriously injured. The Constrictor sued Hercules for damages, and Hercules was convinced by Jennifer Walters, She-Hulk, to do the honorable thing and pay up. With his $168 million in damages, the Constrictor became a member of the idle rich. |||| Although he never felt as if he belonged with such society, Frank Schlicting attended a party hosted by Carlotta LaRosa. This was the event of the year, attended by Tony 'Iron Man' Stark, Kyle 'Nighthawk' Richmond, and Carlotta's then-current boyfriend, Ben 'the Thing“ Grimm. A snubbed debutante who was left off the guest list hired Arcade to kidnap the party-goers and put them in one of his Murderworld amusement parks. As a former villain himself, Nighthawk hoped to convince Frank that he could find a new purpose in life, and the Constrictor helped the Thing and Tony Stark rescue the guests."

Scorpio went after his brother, Nick Fury, with his new group, but was defeated by The Defenders and Moon Knight. |||| |||| The Zodiac LMD's were recruited by Quicksilver during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD's to destory The Avengers for their imagined wrong doings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody. |||| |||| The android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. |||| |||| At some point the android Zodiac captured and presumably killed the human Scorpio, Jacques LaPoint. Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."

373,Jessica Campbell Jones (Marvel),,373_20080116115446_char.jpg,"Flight, super strength, high resistance to injury.",,"Jessica Jones was a lonely Midtown High School student with a crush on fellow student Peter Parker (who would soon become the hero Spider-Man) and a fantasy fixation on the Human Torch. She was on a trip to Disney World with her family when her father, distracted by the backseat quarrel of her and her brother, lost control of their car in an accident with an army truck transporting unidentified experimental material, possibly radioactive, to which Jessica was exposed in the course of the accident. Her father, mother, and brother were killed, and Jessica sustained injuries that put her in a coma for months. While the Fantastic Four clashed with Galactus outside her hospital window, Jessica awoke from her coma; she was placed in a home for wayward children and later adopted by a family named Jones, whose name she took. |||| |||| Months after the accident, while running home from school in an emotionally distraught state, Jessica manifested superhuman powers as a result of the experimental material to which she had been exposed; her inexperienced flying led her to crash-land in the bay, where she was rescued by Thor. She soon realized that she had also gained superhuman strength. While testing her flight capabilities, she chanced upon and defeated the costumed criminal known as the Scorpion, in desperate straits not long after his first defeat by Spider-Man. Proclaimed a hero, Jessica soon took on the costumed identity of Jewel, beginning her heroic career less than three years after Spider-Man's debut. |||| |||| Little is known of Jessica's career as Jewel, but her activities were evidently not as high-profile as those of many of New York's other costumed heroes. Nevertheless, she remained active for around four years, befriending a handful of other heroes, until she came upon a riot provoked by the Purple Man. Using his pheromone powers to take control of her, the Purple Man directed her to attack the approaching police, then held her in his thrall for months, subjecting her to physical and mental humiliation in imagined retaliation for his defeats by other super heroes. Finally, in a fit of insane rage, he sent Jessica to Avengers Mansion hoping she would find and kill his nemesis, Daredevil. Jessica attacked the first hero she saw, the Scarlet Witch, an act that snapped her out of the Purple Man's control. Unprepared to explain her actions, she fled and was pursued by the Avengers, taking a powerful blow from the Vision. Ms. Marvel rescued her from further attack, but Jessica was rendered comatose and cared for in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility until Phoenix of the X-Men telepathically helped her regain her faculties. After weeks of physical rehabilitation, she was offered the position of S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to the Avengers, but Jessica felt that her experience had taught her that she was unsuited to the life of a costumed hero, and she gave up her Jewel identity. Moreover, she found that the Purple Man's mistreatment had left her emotionally unsure of herself, particularly in romantic endeavors. |||| |||| Details of Jessica's subsequent life are sparse, although it is known that she was involved in a string of relationships that ended badly, including one with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain. She also became close friends with Ms. Marvel, who would undergo her own share of trauma during her Avengers membership and afterward. At one point Jessica attempted to return to costumed action as the Knightress, but this period was brief. She eventually became a licensed private investigator and opened her own firm, Alias Investigations. |||| |||| Jessica's recent string of cases included a surveillance assignment involving a woman whose companion was revealed to be Captain America, who changed from his then-secret identity into costume before Jessica's video camera; when the woman whom he had been photographed with was slain, Jessica realized she had been set up. She was questioned by suspicious police officers but helped out of her predicament by the timely arrival of attorney Matt Murdock. Her investigation led to a fight with enforcer Man-Mountain Marko and the revelation that she had been expected to publicize the video with the intent of creating a scandal defaming Captain America and the US government. With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D., Jessica exposed the plot's mastermind, a man named Zoumas, and received the thanks of Captain America, who encouraged her to return to the heroic life. Jessica next investigated a deranged man claiming to be Avengers associate Rick Jones, who paranoically feared attack by the alien races in whose war the real Jones had intervened. Jessica managed to partially calm his madness and reunited him with his wife. She was then hired by J. Jonah Jameson in an effort to track Spider-Man, only to bilk the publisher by spending his money on charitable endeavors. An out-of-town case led her to help troubled teen Rebecca Cross, who had run away after encouraging people to believe she was a mutant out of rebellion against her town's oppressive atmosphere, but the case ended badly when Rebecca's aunt killed her unjustly accused father. |||| |||| When Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdock was exposed, Murdock hired Jessica and the hero-for-hire Luke Cage as bodyguards. This initially proved awkward as Jessica and Cage had had a brief fling which strained their friendship, but they soon resolved their difficulties. Jessica instead began dating Scott Lang, the Avenger known as Ant-Man, with whom she was set up by her friend Carol Danvers, formerly Ms. Marvel and now Warbird. She next found herself investigating the Mutant Growth Hormone trade, and teamed up with fellow superhuman investigator and ex-costumed heroine Jessica Drew to rescue Mattie Franklin, the young heroine formerly known as Spider-Woman, from being misused by the dealers. She also hired the dedicated but annoying young Malcolm Powder as a part-time assistant. When the Kingpin sent the insane assassin Typhoid Mary against Murdock, Jessica and Cage worked together against her, getting her on the ropes so that Murdock could deliver a blow to end the fight. |||| |||| Jessica's greatest challenge came when relatives of some of the Purple Man's victims asked her to confront the imprisoned villain about his many murders, several of them committed on whims, in hopes that he would give their families a sense of closure by confessing to his killings. She was greatly apprehensive about confronting her former tormentor, but being consoled by Cage, she agreed to visit the Purple Man in prison, only to receive no useful information from the psychopathic mind-controller. The Purple Man then escaped in the chaos caused by the breakout of fellow prisoner Carnage, and he sought out Jessica in order to again control her. When the Avengers arrived, he commanded Jessica to fight them, but she activated a psychic defense trigger left in her mind by Phoenix years earlier and defied him, knocking him out with one blow. |||| In the aftermath of the confrontation, Jessica informed Ant-Man that she was pregnant with another man's child and the couple broke up. She instead moved in with Cage, the father, and the two began a long-term relationship. Jessica has since taken a position as a superhuman consultant with the Daily Bugle, working with reporter Ben Urich on stories related to New York's growing super hero population. After their daughter was born, Jessica and Luke were married in the company of their heroic friends."

One of them called him Solomon Grundy when he said that he was 'born on Monday' like in the Mother Goose rhyme.  He led the group through several heists, and Green Lantern Alan Scott's ring would not work against him, so he didn't understand why the criminals cared about Green Lantern.  They instructed him to kill Green Lantern by throwing him off a terrace.  When he did so, there was a large green and yellow explosion.  He then grabbed a member of his gang, Jake, and threw him to the floor.  The rest of the gang told him that you should only kill enemies, but Jake was already dead, which Grundy did not understand because of the lack of flashes. |||| |||| After Green Lantern, whose ring would not work against Grundy because of his plant composition, pushed him in front of a train, he has consistently sought revenge against Green Lantern, and has been amoral enough to harm others who have gotten in his way.  Eventually, Green Lanterns Alan Scott and Hal Jordan sent him to the moon, where he had what was described as 'his first independent thought,' traveling to Earth-1, believing that he may have an equivalent there who would be his friend. |||| |||| His body was fragmented and sent to Earth-1, where it battled Superman, even as Swamp Thing Alec Holland attempted to save him, but Swamp Thing was still experiencing too much pain in speaking to communicate with Superman why he thought Grundy should be saved.  These duplicates were destroyed with a formula created by S.T.A.R. Labs. |||| |||| When Solomon Grundy learned of Scott's children, Jade and Obsidian, he attempted to kill them, but Jade showed him kindness, and he was willing to obey her, although he became subject to wicked forces and eventually conquered their team, Infinity, Inc. |||| |||| When Lex Luthor sent Swamp Thing reeling into Space, the Parliament of Trees assumed that he was dead and tried to put a new Swamp Thing, known as the Sprout, into Grundy's body.  When Swamp Thing returned, he was relieved that Grundy was not dead, but Grundy had no memory of him, and they fought.  Swamp Thing found Grundy too corrupt to be Earth's Elemental, and prevented the Sprout from assimilating with him."
3945,Doctor Druid (Marvel),Dr. Anthony Ludgate ,3945_20070103013322_char.jpg,"Doctor Anthony Druid's powers were based on the mystical development of his own mind and body. He had remarkable control over his body and bodily systems, could communicate telepathically, and could psychically mesmerize others, often casting illusions directly into their minds. He could levitate and perform telekinesis to a small extent. Druid also possessed a high degree of magical sensitivity, in detecting magical energies as well as sensing impending danger. |||| Druid supplemented these powers with magical spells he has learned over the years. He had a large repertoire of druidic rituals, including one that can bridge dimensions. |||| |||| More recently, Druid was bonded to nature physically and spiritually by Druidic gods. As such, Druid could mentally control and manipulate plant life, earth, and animals within his vicinity, the full extent and range of which remain unknown. ||||",,"Anthony Druid got his medical degree from Harvard, then went on to study psychiatry. He retired from his psychiatric practice after several years to devote more time to his growing interest in the occult. He supported himself by writing popular books on psychology and related matters and by lecturing. In the midst of his research for a second book on the occult, Druid was summoned by an ailing Tibetan lama apparently in need of medical aid. The lama put Druid through a series of bizarre mystic and spiritual tests to ascertain Druid's worthiness. Finding him worthy, the dying lama opened Druid's mind to its hidden powers and taught him the mastery of certain mystic arts. (Apparently, the lama was actually the Ancient One, mentor of the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme. Druid was one of the Ancient One's first attempts at giving a disciple a degree of his powers.) |||| |||| Druid had remained in seclusion for several years, investigating occult matters personally and in secret. At one point, he teamed up with other clandestine 'monster-hunters', including Bloodstone and the Eternal hero Makkari, in stopping a threat from the underworldly Deviants. Soon, the Fantastic Four appeared, ushering in Earth's Age of Marvels, and later, Druid would find himself aiding the hero team Avengers against the Celtic monsters known as the Fomor. |||| |||| Doctor Druid was instrumental in freeing the Avengers Mansion from its occupation by the Masters of Evil, and he applied successfully for Avengers membership shortly thereafter. Not long after joining, Druid fell under the mental control of Ravonna (then called Nebula, later Terminatrix), who used Druid's mental powers to manipulate the Avengers into aiding her search for an ultimate weapon. Druid manipulated the other Avengers into electing him chairman to this end, but the Avengers soon discovered the plotters and opposed them in a conflict that ended with Druid and Ravonna being lost in the time stream. |||| |||| Druid eventually escaped, free of Ravonna's influence, rejuvenated into a younger version of himself and with a renewed purpose. He renewed his association with the Avengers as an occasional inactive reservist in hopes of mending fences with the group. For a time, he led the occult adventurers called the Shock Troop and later served with the Secret Defenders as the team's puppet leader under the auspices of Doctor Strange. |||| |||| More recently, Druid embarked on an obsessive quest to augment his magical powers, one which eventually led to his pact with Druidic gods of Celtic lore. The gods performed a grisly spell on Druid, binding him to nature in such a way to allow him to control plants and earth around him. Druid tried to surround himself with loyal followers, including the villain Nekra, who nevertheless supported and seduced Druid. Nekra, however, later summoned her true lord, Hellstorm, the Son of Satan, who battled Druid. Hellstorm mocked Druid, killing him and tossing his burning body in a garbage can. |||| |||| Druid was briefly resurrected alongside other fallen Avengers by the Grim Reaper, in order to serve in the Legion of the Unliving against the Avengers. He and the others broke free of the Reaper’s thrall, however, and returned to the afterlife."

Refusing offers to Paris, Milan, and London, she instead wanted to use her powers as a force for good. |||| |||| Crawford is a flamboyant and bawdy brawler in the field, inventive in the use of her mutant powers. Crawford's group, formerly known as Great Lakes Avengers, recently complied with a cease-and-desist order to stop infringing on the Avengers franchise, which led to the group's present name. At one point, Crawford and her teammates assisted S.H.I.E.L.D. in an attempt to apprehend the then-fugitive Thunderbolts in the Colorado Rockies, in an operation led by Colonel G.W. Bridge. Although the operation ultimately failed, it displayed Crawford's willingness to support law enforcement agencies. Crawford's stance on the mutant question is unknown, but it would appear that she is more concerned with balancing her conflicting supermodel/superhero careers than with the global conflict between humans and mutants. |||| |||| In fact, she recently suffered a crisis of conscience after the team’s member Dinah Soar died during a mission. She briefly considered leaving the team and pursuing her modeling career, but she came to realize that she liked being with a group who could look past her outward appearance, both good or bad.

It was only when the inhuman Triton braved the Negative Zone to save an adrift Mister Fantastic that the Explosive Belt around Earth revived Blastaar and he followed the pair through their portal and into the Baxter Building. There he met up with and joined the Sandman in order to take over Earth, but the Fantastic Four, with the help of Crystal, beat him and used one of Reed's inventions to shut off his powers, allowing them to return him to the Negative Zone. Since then, Blastaar has tried to return to Earth and conquer it, but has been repulsed many times by various super heroes; including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. While adventuring in the Negative Zone, the Fantastic Four have since run into Blastaar again on many occasions. Blastaar has also regained the throne of Baluur for himself, and then begun a conquest of the Negative Zone, which has been primarily kept in check by the interference of Blastaar's hated enemy, Annihilus."

Most of Martinex's adventures take place in an alternate future as a member of the 31st century Guardians of the Galaxy. |||| |||| In their future, Earth had colonized several planets in its solar system, including Pluto. Martinex was born on Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of Africa on Earth. |||| |||| He grew up to become a scientist. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystaline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Pluvian after the Badoon exterminated all the other Pluvians. Martinex escaped the Badoon and teamed with Vance Astro, a human astronaut from the 20th century, Charlie-27, a Jovian, and Yondu, from Alpha Centauri, to fight the Badoon as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Eventually, the Guardians drove the Badoon from Earth and Martinex later became the team's reluctant leader. |||| |||| While looking for the shield of Captain America, the Guardians came into conflict with a team of superhumans known as Force. Martinex was badly injured by a member of Force known as Brawl. Much of the crystals that covered Martinex's body were shattered, but Martinex recovered with the help of fellow Guardian Starhawk. All of the exterior crystals on Martinex fell away, leaving Martinex with a new crystaline appearance, one that was less faceted, and somewhat purple in tone. |||| |||| Eventually, Martinex left the team to form a larger version of the Guardians, known as the Galactic Guardians.

8210,Seth (Marvel)(01 - Egyptian god),"Set, Sutekh, Typhon ",8210_20070126015958_char.jpg,"Seth has the attributes of a god of Heliopolis such as superhuman strength, immunity to all terrestrial disease and is immortal. Before the loss of his right hand, Seth was able to lift at least 90 tons but even now remains at superhuman levels. Seth, as all the gods of Heliopolis, he has flesh that is at least three times denser than that of human tissue, and has superhuman endurance. Seth’s powers also include the ability to provoke a person’s death with just a touch, or he can mystically speed up the aging process causing one to grow old in seconds. He can project concussive blasts from his hand, and he can project hypnotic powers from his eyes. Seth can also transform into a large serpent and retain his speech.",,"The gods of Heliopolis were once worshiped by the people of Egypt. Seth happens to be the God of death, and he initially sought out worshipers by deceiving a cult who followed the serpent demon Set. Since he could transform himself into a giant serpent, he made the cult believe that he was Set and they then chose to worship him. He also took a variation of the serpent demon’s name calling himself Seth. |||| |||| The god Osiris was the ruler of ancient Egypt and his wife is Isis, goddess of fertility. It was said that Seth was the offspring of these two Heliopolitan gods, but this statement has been proven false. Seth, in actuality, wanted to overthrow Osiris and claim himself ruler of the Gods of Heliopolis. Seth’s blood lust was fueled even further when his own wife, Nephthys, had a son, Anubis, with Osiris. Seth hatched a plan that enabled him to trick Osiris into entering a coffin and seal him away in a hidden location. However, Isis had eventually found the coffin, but Seth would not be denied his vengeance. He dismembered Osiris’ body into fourteen pieces and placed them in several places throughout Egypt. Isis would not have her husband disrespected that way, so she gathered up all of the pieces and used an ancient, forgotten magic to make her husband whole once more. Once resurrected, Osiris ordered his sons Anubis and Horus, who also helped with their father’s return, to find Seth so that he may pay for his betrayal. |||| |||| Seth and Osiris battled for many years, and in the end, Seth used deception to achieve his victory. Osiris, Isis and Horus were trapped within a pyramid that Seth sank under the sands. Seth then took control of the other-dimensional city of Heliopolis, and claimed that his enemies would never be free to plague him again. Seth also boasted that the only way they would be freed is if their ancestor, Atum-Re, were to return to Earth. The overthrown Heliopolitan gods stayed buried for many years until the pyramid was discovered in the United States. It was at this time that the three trapped deities used their magic to convince Odin, ruler of Asgard that he was Atum-Re so that they may be free once more. The son of Odin, the mighty Thor, wanted the Heliopolitan gods to remove the spell they cast, so he traveled with them to Heliopolis to confront the death god. The five of them battled Seth’s skeleton army, and Thor was convinced how great a threat Seth was, so he engaged him in battle directly. During their battle, Odin projected an energy blast at Seth that destroyed his right hand and led him to be defeated. Osiris then cast Seth off the Golden Bridge of the Gods and reclaimed leadership of Heliopolis when Seth was swallowed up by the ground below. |||| |||| Sometime later, Seth returned and captured his brother once more. He also captured his brother’s wife and son, Horus who he planned to sacrifice to gain control of a demon called the Devourer. Unfortunately for Seth, the Devourer turned against him, and it took the combined might of Thor and the Thing to defeat it. With Seth defeated, Osiris and his family were freed. Soon after, Seth formed an alliance with Mephisto and others who ruled the land of the dead such as Pluto and Hela to merge their realms into an individual realm of the dead so that their powers would be united. When these gods of the dead used their powers to unite the realms, Demogorge, the God-Eater was summoned and he ate Seth and the others. If not for Thor, Seth and the other gods of the dead would not have been saved. Fearing to release Demorgorge again, these individuals ended their alliance. |||| |||| After, the Rainbow Bridge had been destroyed severing the path between Earth and Asgard, Seth sent his armies to invade Asgard just as he sent his minion Grog the God Crusher to Earth to assassinate Thor. However, Thor was on the Avengers floating headquarters, Hydrobase, and when Grog attacked and Thor was assisted by the Black Knight and the Captain. Between the three of them, Grog’s forces were defeated and Grog was taken to the former prison for superhuman criminals, the Vault. After that, while Thor was attacked at a construction site by an assassin named Mongoose, the gods of Asgard sent Hogun, the Grim to Earth to find Thor and tell him of Seth’s invasion. Hogun did arrive on Earth, but his senses were scrambled and everyone around him appeared to be a threat which led him to a conflict with Daredevil and the police. The police gunned him down despite the protests of Daredevil, and Hogun had to be taken to the hospital where he was close to death. At the hospital, Seth made a bargain with three mortals who also lied at death’s door. He gave them incredible power and a vow to let them continue to live if they killed Hogun. Together these three, known as Earth Force, had an inevitable run in with Thor who was at the hospital once he got word that Hogun was there. Even though they had Thor beaten, two of the three members decided that they should rethink their position and leave before they did something they would regret. Hogun was confronted by Seth the realm of death and refused to surrender his life, so Seth assaulted Hougun leaving his mark upon him. |||| |||| Thor saved the life of Hogun with a blood transfusion, and then received the news about Asgard’s recent troubles. Earth Force then returned asking to be granted a second chance to show they are not truly evil, and that they were tricked by Seth into attacking Thor. The group traveled to the Vault where they questioned Grog who was being watched by the Black Knight. Grog opened a portal to the realm of Seth in order to escape, but the heroes followed. During the resulting battle, Balder decided that the power of Thor must be brought back to Asgard in order to defend themselves against Seth’s armies, Thor’s powers were siphoned off and given to Balder leaving Thor at the mercy of Grog. It wasn’t long before the rest of the heroes, except for Wind Warrior, were captured. With the heroes in captivity, Seth launched his attack on Asgard. Thor and the others eventually broke free and defeated Grog and his minions, so that they could finally bring the fight to Seth. Grog, fearing for his life, brought the heroes to the Black Pyramid and there Thor released Bes, the Heliopolitan God of luck. Bes revealed Seth’s plan to exterminate all life, and he was able to be so successful because he kept the odds in his favor by using the power of Bes. Wind Warrior, meanwhile, found the rest of the Heliopoiltan gods that had their powers stolen by Seth, and they, too, converged on the Black Pyramid. Yet inside the pyramid, Thor and the others broke into a room where they found the All-Father, Odin, a prisoner. |||| Now with Odin free and with Wind Warrior’s return, Grog returned with reinforcements to begin the battle anew. In Asgard, the Celtic gods led by Leir, Lord of Lightning, acted as reinforcements to help against the legions of Seth. The battle on Asgard took a turn for the worst as it appeared that Balder met his end at the hand of Seth, and with that, all of Thor’s powers were returned to him. Thor and the others made quick work of Grog’s forces, and Thor destroyed the Black Pyramid enraged over Balder’s apparent death. Odin left to aid Asgard just as Surtur, the fire demon, arrived to Seth’s realm looking for him but instead found Thor. |||| Thor used Odin’s power to become as large as Surtur and the two engaged in battle. Odin returned to Asgard just as Seth’s armies were about to emerge victorious and inspired his forces to fight back once more. Earth Force attacked Seth but were ultimately defeated and left to die. Seth transformed himself into a giant serpent and attacked Odin while the blood curse of the Black Knight paralyzed him and his body became as stiff a statue. Upon seeing his son in battle with Surtur, Odin became distracted and Seth gained the upper hand. Hogun attacked Seth so that he would leave Odin and follow him, but in doing so Seth sealed his fate. Hogun used the body of the Black Knight to mortally wound Seth, and his serpent form shrank down into nothingness leaving Asgard and its allies triumphant. Thor defeated Surtur and Odin imprisoned the fire demon within himself, and the Egyptian gods used their powers to heal Earth Force and send them back to Earth with their powers intact. |||| |||| Seth reemerged, with a new look and both hands undamaged, in an underwater base beneath the Hudson River which he called his Armageddon Complex. The psychotic vigilante, Bloodaxe was the first to uncover his base, and he was also the first to be defeated at the hands of Seth. After his defeat, he called for help from his enemy Thunderstrike and together they confronted Seth in his underwater base. Seth revealed his plans to make genetically engineered troops and exploit mankind as he saw fit. Bloodaxe and Thunderstrike attacked the death god, but they were no match for his power, and Seth placed the mark of death upon Thunderstrike’s chest. If not for the timely intervention of Stellaris, Thunderstrike may have perished in the initial attack. After Thunderstrike flooded Seth’s Armageddon Complex, Seth was forced to use his mobile underwater transport as a base. Seth was also visited by the disembodied spirit of Loki looking to make a deal. In exchange for a genetically engineered body for his spirit to reside in, Loki would help the death god dispose of Thunderstrike. Seth readily agreed, and made a new body for the god of mischief. Loki intended to keep his part of the bargain as he tried to trick She-Hulk into killing Thunderstrike, but when Ant-Man and War Machine arrived on the scene, Loki was the one who was bested. Later at a newly constructed base, Thunderstrike, now with the power of his mace and the Executioner’s axe, paid a visit to Seth. Seth tried to seduce Thunderstrike into joining him, but it didn't work. The two of them battled furiously, but it ended when Thunderstrike used the combined powers of the mace and axe to seemingly kill the death god. |||| |||| Recently, Seth tried to recruit followers in the forms of Black Spectre, Bushman and Morpheus in order to strike at his enemy, the moon god Khonshu. However, a newly resurrected Moon Knight stood in his way. Seth, in the guise of a statue of Set, would lash out at Moon Knight in his dreams and even came to life when the ebony energy of Morpheus struck the statue. In the end, Morpheus was defeated by Moon Knight and the statue of Set was destroyed. |||| |||| The god of death has not been seen since."

He rants about the damage done to the plant world by humanity, and attempts to take revenge for this. His grandest attempt at this is using his newly gained innate plant control power to make them produce an excess of oxygen so the slightest spark could cause devastating fires around the world. However, he was foiled when the Swamp Thing pointed out that this attempt was in fact devastating the plants since killing all the oxygen breathers would mean cutting off the production of carbon dioxide that plants need to live. |||| |||| He fights the Atom on several occasions and was a member of one of the incarnations of the Injustice Gang. |||| |||| The Floronic Man was briefly a hero, after the events of Millennium led to him becoming a member of the New Guardians. After the death of most of his teammates, he seems to have reverted to his original status as a villain. |||| |||| The character has appeared in various other comics and storylines: in a recent issue of Batman he was killed after assassins shot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance, in which he pointed out that 'you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head'.

X-51 is highly dependant on solar receptors for energy, and if not exposed to light, he will shut down.",,"The robot X-51 was created from a top-secret U.S. military project that hoped to make a robot soldier that could think like a man. 51 experimental robots were engineered, but Dr. Abel Stack, computer heuristics programming specialist, knew that the robot could only think like a man if he was treated as one. He stole the 51st robot and began treating him as if he were his own son, calling him Machine Man and even creating an artificial face for him from simulated flesh and hair. Dr. Stack was proven correct: the other 50 robots began experiencing severe personality defects and were deemed too dangerous; the government ordered that the robots’ self-destruct mechanisms be activated. Unfortunately, in the process of removing Machine Man’s self-destruct, Dr. Stack himself was killed when it went off. |||| |||| Vowing to fulfill Dr. Stack's dream, Machine Man adopted a human identity, Aaron Stack, and tried to find his place in the world of human beings. He eventually met psychiatrist Peter Spaulding and mechanic 'Gears' Garyin, who would become his friends. He worked for a time as an insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company, although his employer and fellow employees were unaware he was a robot. |||| |||| Machine Man fought to preserve himself in a world that feared the machine, especially against Senator Miles Brickman and the costumed villain Madame Menace.

At the time, the robot had acquired the head of Jocasta, which had been recovered and lost by agents of the villainous High Evolutionary. In the course of this battle, Machine Man narrowly avoided a confrontation with Madame Menace, who ultimately ended up with the Jocasta head. Machine Man again aided the Avengers West Coast branch, being accepted as one of their member so he could join them in the fight against the villains Doctor Demonicus and the Pacific Overlords. As a provisional member of the Avengers, he joined them on a couple more adventures, and was peripherally involved in the battle between the villain Graviton and the heroes of the Thunderbolts. |||| |||| After several months, Machine Man was then captured by the international espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. who wanted to use his technology to further the creation of the new Deathlok cyborg. At the same time, the villainous Red Skull captured the techno-organic being Douglock and took over the SHIELD's Helicarrier transport. Machine Man assisted the heroes of the X-Men in rescuing Douglock and the SHIELD agents trapped onboard, seemingly at the cost of his own life. |||| |||| However, the evil mutant team called the Brotherhood recovered what was left of Machine Man and captured SHIELD Agent Jack Kubrick who was also searching for the robot. After discovering the remains, Brotherhood members Mimic, Blob, Mystique, Toad, and Post were attacked by the recently resurrected Machine Man. During the battle Post shot and seemingly killed Kubrick, but the agent merged with Machine Man`s head and claimed that he was, in fact, X-51 in a new body. As X-51, he discovered his new body contained microscopic nanotech machines called 'nanites' that could repair any damage instantly. X-51 also found that his new programming included remnants of mutant-hunting Sentinel programming, and thus felt compelled to attack and destroy any mutants that he came into contact with. He immediately tried to destroy the Brotherhood and then, afterward, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries and the world-dominating Hellfire Club. When he sought the Avengers for help, he attacked their newest members Justice and Firestar before retreating. |||| |||| X-51 recognized his internal systems were somehow affected and he sought help from his friends in the past, Peter Spaulding and his wife, Jill. The two tried to help the robot but X-51 had become targeted by the Sentinels, the same mutant-hunting machines that had corrupted his systems. The fight between X-51 and the Sentinels threatened to destroy the town if not for the timely arrival of the X-Men. Unfortunately, during the fight, the Sentinels' technology overwhelmed X-51, and he turned on the X-Men. The X-Men battled X-51 until he experienced a moment of mental clarity. In his final act of heroism, X-51, unbeknownst to the X-Men, willingly gave up his own life to stop the battle, allowing his robotic body to explode. |||| |||| At the same time, the United States government had deemed X-51 a threat and ordered Jack Kubrick, agent of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, to investigate. Kubrick was presumably assigned the case because X-51 had been using his identity since presumably merging with Kubrick during X-51's encounter with the mutant Brotherhood. It seemed that the Kubrick absorbed by X-51 was in fact an android (a Life Model Decoy.) The real agent Kubrick investigated the circumstances of X-51's death and returned to the Commission with his report. |||| |||| In fact, X-51 did not truly perish. The nanotechnology in his system rebuilt his body, this time free of Sentinel technology, as well as his mind. X-51's memories were lost, except for those of his father, which he purposefully retained. X-51 began wandering the country, but he soon encountered an alien monolith. The monolith somehow transported itself and X-51 away to an unknown destination. |||| |||| X-51 has since reappeared and taken on a more human appearance than ever before, despite the fact that he is more open to criticize the lifestyles of the “fleshy ones” around him. Calling himself simply “Aaron Stack,” he joined the H.A.T.E. organization, under circumstances yet to be revealed, working with other heroes such as Monica Rambeau (Photon) and Tabitha Smith (Meltdown) in Nextwave. When the heroes discovered H.A.T.E. was actually funding the terrorists they hoped to stop, Aaron joined Nextwave in dedicating themselves to stopping H.A.T.E. once and for all. |||| |||| Note: In a previous account of an alternate 1990, Machine Man was deactivated and buried by his old enemy, industrialist Sunset Bain, alias Madame Menace. In this timeline, Machine Man remained buried until 2020 when he is exhumed and reactivated by a youthful gang of technology scavengers called the Midnight Wreckers."

Stripped of his awards and livelihood, Garrett sought new direction in the Triune Understanding, a philosophical movement that preaches the fulfillment of one's innate potential by balancing various aspects of environment and self. Developing a superhuman triple-powered physique, Garrett believed the Triune teachings had unlocked his latent powers, and he became the costumed hero Triathlon while serving as a celebrity spokesman for the Triune Understanding. Aiding the Avengers against Moses Magnum, Triathlon worked well with the group, but tensions arose after unscrupulous Triune leader Jonathan Tremont began a secret smear campaign against the Avengers as part of a Triune publicity ploy, painting the Avengers as religiously intolerant and racially biased. |||| |||| |||| Unaware of Tremont's true nature and secret plans, Delroy began to believe that the increasingly hostile Avengers might be intolerant, even racist; but the feud came to an unexpected end when the Avengers' government liaison Duane Freeman-another Triune follower-convinced the Avengers to recruit Triathlon, since he was a capable hero whose visible minority status and Triune background would help defuse much of the group's negative publicity. Determined to prove the Avengers wrong about the Triunes, Triathlon joined the team. Wary of his fellow Avengers and resenting the circumstances of his recruitment, Delroy was a bitter and disruptive presence at first; but he gradually became a valued and enthusiastic Avenger, thanks in part to advice and support from Warbird and Pulsar. |||| |||| |||| Teaming with Tremont to confront the cosmic menace known as the Triple-Evil, the Avengers learned that Tremont had founded the Triunes to face the Triple-Evil; that he had smeared the Avengers' reputation as part of his efforts to amass Triune influence; that only three scattered cosmic energy shards formed by the universe as 'cosmic antibodies' could neutralize the Triple-Evil; and that two of these shards had come to Earth, where one empowered the 3-D Man (a triple-powered 1950s hero formed by the merger of brothers Hal and Chuck Chandler) and another empowered Tremont, who secretly captured 3-D Man in recent times and merged him into unwitting Triune follower Delroy. Having found the third energy shard in space while facing the Triple-Evil, Tremont tried to take all three shards for himself, but Delroy-still merged with the now-conscious Chandlers-absorbed all three shards. |||| |||| |||| With his newly cosmic power, Triathlon banished the Triple-Evil and helped liberate Earth from Kang; he then gave up his cosmic powers-which had been fuelled by the souls of the Triple-Evil's countless victims-and used the last of his cosmic energy to restore the Chandlers to their separate human forms, regaining his own normal form in the process. Declining to participate in the Triunes' reorganization after Tremont's death in battle with the forces of Kang, Triathlon soon left the Avengers as well, though he has returned to aid them against threats such as Scorpio and an insane Scarlet Witch."
478,Poison Ivy (DC)(Pamela Isley),Pamela Lillian Isley ,478_20070303090432_char.jpg,,,"Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley) is a fictional character, a DC Comics supervillainess who is primarily an enemy of Batman. Created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, she first appeared in Batman #181 (June 1966).[1] |||| |||| Poison Ivy is depicted as one of the world's most prominent eco-terrorists. She is obsessed with plants, botany, and environmentalism. She uses toxins from plants and mind controlling pheromones for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting the natural environment. Fellow villain Harley Quinn became her recurring partner-in-crime and possibly her only human friend. She has proven to be one of Batman's more powerful foes, being one of the few members of his Rogues Gallery to display anything close to superpowers. Pamela Isley a.k.a. Poison Ivy has been portrayed as a love interest for Batman in some comics. In one comic, Ivy was robbing a charity gala Bruce Wayne was attending. Ivy's first kiss was poison, the second its antidote. When they first meet, Ivy's toxic lips planted a seed of toxic rapture in Bruce. But when she later kissed a dying Dark Knight, Ivy unknowingly cured her intended victim and established a budding romantic tension between them. |||| |||| Creator Robert Kanigher modeled Poison Ivy after Bettie Page, giving her the same haircut and Southern drawl as Page. In her first appearances in 1966, no origin was developed; she was merely a temptress. When she first arrived in Gotham City, her costume was a one-piece, strapless green bathing suit, covered with leaves. Leaves also formed her bracelets, necklace and crown. She wore green high heels and yellow-green nylon stockings with leaves painted on them. These particulars changed somewhat when she re-appeared. |||| |||| Poison Ivy was promoted after the rise of feminism pointed out the need for a greater number of more independent female villains in the series. She was also used to replace the increasingly sympathetic Catwoman as a clearly antagonistic female supervillain foil for Batman, and then made further appearances in the Batman comic book series and in Suicide Squad. The second, retconned origin story provided for her by Neil Gaiman in the late 1980s linked her to Swamp Thing and his original Black Orchid as a human-plant hybrid. She has since appeared in starring roles in Gotham City Sirens and Birds of Prey. |||| |||| In the 1997 film, Batman & Robin, she was portrayed by Uma Thurman. Poison Ivy has been featured in the television series, Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman, brought to life by voice actresses Diane Pershing and Piera Coppola respectively. She is significantly younger on The Batman than in any of her other incarnations – a teenager in fact, who nevertheless proves to be one of the most powerful criminals in the world. |||| |||| IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64.[2] She was ranked 21st in Comics Buyer's Guide's '100 Sexiest Women in Comics' list.[3] |||| |||| from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(comics)"

Horton for scientific purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton's creation burst into flames when exposed to oxygen, and, with human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, rebelled against his creator. Public outcry led to the Torch's being sealed in concrete, which Horton did until he could find a way to control the android's flames, though he eventually escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in. While the Torch then inadvertently caused parts of New York City to burn, he eventually learned to control his flame and vowed to help humanity. |||| |||| He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the Axis powers. During this time he acquired a young partner, Thomas 'Toro' Raymond. Toro was the mutant son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to radiation gave him the ability to control fire. The Human Torch also joined the police force as part of his 'human cover' under the name Jim Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villains and his off-and-on foe, the Sub-Mariner. During World War II Jim helped allied forces and the Invaders fight the Axis powers. Near the end of the war, Jim came face-to-face with Adolf Hitler and killed him with his bare hands. |||| |||| After the war the Torch was placed in deactivation sleep in the Mojave Desert; an atomic bomb test awoke him. Learning that Toro had been captured by the Soviets and brainwashed, the Torch rescued his old partner and learned that the nuclear bomb's radiation had made his powers both much stronger and more unstable. Eventually, fearing he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up his energy reserve and effectively deactivating himself. The Mad Thinker later rebuilt the Torch, restraining his flame and editing his memory so he would forget having been a hero, then sent him after the Fantastic Four. Jim soon fought with the new Human Torch at the Thinker's behest, though he was loathe to actually murder him. But the rest of the four soon appeared, along with Wyatt Wingfoot, and captured him, transporting him back to the Thinker's lab with Lockjaw's help. There, the original Torch rebelled against the Thinker, refusing to be a party to murder, and the Thinker used his computer, Quasimodo, to fire a ray that shut off the invisible coating of protective nitrogen cells, which kept his flame in check, and he burned himself out. A duplicate of his body was later created by the time traveler Immortus; this copy was obtained by the villainous robot Ultron, who used it to create the Vision, an android who went on to join the Avengers |||| |||| The Torch was revived again by the Scarlet Witch â€” who was searching for answers about her husband, the Vision â€” and Ann Raymond, widow of Tom 'Toro' Raymond. He served the Avengers for a while before losing his powers to save the former superheroine Spitfire. His powers gone, he decided to settle down with Ann Raymond. He became the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Prince Namor. From there, he served as 'boss' to the mercenary group Heroes for Hire, while being secretly manipulated by the Master of the World. When the group disbanded, he went off on his own, before being asked to become the head of V-Battalion upon the retirement of Roger Aubrey, the Destroyer. |||| |||| Recently, while on leave from the V-Battalion and working with the new Invaders, he became attached to Tara, a recently-constructed female android based on him, whom he came to regard as a daughter of sorts. He also struck up a renewed acquaintance with Spitfire to the dismay of her beau, the current Union Jack, while beginning to show signs that his powers were regenerating. |||| Unfortunately, Tara was revealed to be a plant, created by the Red Skull, with overrides on her developing personality allowing the Invaders' enemies, the Axis Mundi, to use her as a weapon against the team. Refusing to believe that she was truly gone, he found himself able to flame on again, and tried to channel the heat from her system to shut her down before she overloaded and killed all the Invaders, herself included. While he was able to stop her meltdown, his own systems could not handle the sheer heat, and he flew high into the atmosphere before detonating. |||| |||| Captain America makes him an agent of SHIELD in All-New Invaders #5."

317,Hobgoblin (Marvel)(02 - Roderick Kingsley),Roderick Kingsley. ,317_20060421232322_char.jpg,"In the beginning of his career Kingsley had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand the notes of Norman Osborn regarding the Green Goblin Formula and other inventions to the extent that Kingsley was eventually able to complete Norman's work and even improved many of Osborn's various inventions. He also had expertise in areas outside of the original Green Goblin's knowledge. Kingsley was a master of hypnosis and drug induced mind control. Kingsley was highly skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses. He was also a talented fashion designer. |||| |||| Due to the green chemical that he bathed in, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength similar to that of Spider-Man. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are also enhanced to superhuman levels, as well as his intelligence, but at an extraordinary level. He was actually physically stronger than the original Green Goblin in the beginning, because of longer exposure to the formula. The derivative of the Green Goblin formula Kingsley used did not apparently drive him as insane as the original formula did to Norman Osborn, thanks to some certain modifications, though both Kingsley and his brother did at times worry that he had indeed developed insanity. |||| |||| He is armed with a variety of bizarre incendiary devices and uses a Goblin Glider as a personal transport. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable.",,"The original Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley, was an enemy of Spider-Man and for a large portion of his criminal career, he initially had no superhuman powers, though he did acquire them later. Of all of Spider-Man's enemies who tried to adopt Norman Osborn's legacy, only Kingsley came close to being as threatening and dangerous as the original Green Goblin. He wore a variant of the Green Goblin's costume distinguished by a hood, cape and a different color scheme. |||| |||| Upon examining the lair and gleaning the secrets within it, Kingsley decided to adopt the legacy of the Green Goblin almost in its entirety. Using the Green Goblin's equipment, Kingsley adopted the identity of the Hobgoblin (which should not be confused with the second Green Goblin who was Harry Osborn). His activities included using some of Norman Osborn's files on prominent figures to blackmail them, and attempting to buy Osborn's old corporation and merge it with his own. These schemes inevitably brought him into conflict with Spider-Man. Kingsley perceived Spider-Man as a nuisance and sought to eliminate him almost as an afterthought, rather than a principal goal. Kingsley also found among Norman's notes incomplete remnants of the strength enhancing potion of Norman Osborn. He became obsessed with finding the complete formula or perfecting the incomplete notes. In his various criminal activities Kingsley repeatedly lost to the web-slinger, as he lacked the raw physical power of Spider-Man. |||| |||| Persistent and extremely intelligent, Kingsley eventually recovered the strength-enhancing potion he sought. Being well aware that the formula had driven Osborn insane, Kingsley was not about to try it until he had tested it on someone else. He tricked a small-time hood in his employ, Lefty Donovan, into administering the formula and then used mind control to force Donovan to fight Spider-Man in the Hobgoblin costume. From a distance, Kingsley carefully monitored Donovan's vital signs and behavior. When Spider-Man overwhelmed and unmasked Donovan, and his brainwashing begin to fail, Kingsley acted quickly to protect his identity by programming Donovan's glider to crash, instantly killing him. Though Donovan's tenure as a Hobgoblin was brief, he is considered the second Hobgoblin. Judging that the experiment was a success, Kingsley then immersed himself in his completed derivative of the Goblin formula and gained slightly greater strength than even the original Green Goblin had. |||| |||| Now that he had become a physical match for Spider-Man, the Hobgoblin became more ambitious in his villainy. Despite his increased abilities, he was still narrowly defeated by Spider-Man. Worse still, he seemed to have attracted the attention of powerful criminal interests who perceived him as a threat, among these the infamous Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of Crime. After a bitter encounter with Spider-Man, Kingsley discovered he had been followed by Daily Bugle reporter Ned Leeds, who had discovered his lair. Kingsley carefully brainwashed Ned Leeds with hypnosis and hallucinogenics into becoming the third Hobgoblin, who acted in concert with Kingsley. Though Leeds lacked superhuman strength, he was effective in his role due to his investigative skills (in fact, he was more effective than the Hobgoblin IV after he had acquired superhuman abilities). Kingsley also discovered that Leeds had been working with the Kingpin's son, Richard Fisk, on a plan to bring down the Kingpin and his empire. Richard Fisk had now adopted the identity of the Rose and posed as a crimelord. Kingsley used Leeds to handle some of the negotiations, fooling many into believing that Leeds was the Hobgoblin. He hoped to use the Kingpin's downfall as an opportunity to advance his own interests."

Nightside can utilize this energy for a variety of purposes, including enshrouding her opponents in a cloak of darkness, displace projectile attacks against her person by opening small apertures into the Darkforce dimension, and cause beings and objects to be engulfed by the Darkforce, thus plunging them into the nightmarish void that is the Darkforce realm.",,"Nightside is a member of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. She was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Nightside was later amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Nightside remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Nightside was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Nightside was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Nightside, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| Subsequently, Nightside was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. ||||"

Eternity's humanoid form is an artifical manifestation and cannot be perceived unless he wishes to make contact with a humanoid.",,"Eternity came into existence when the universe was formed (along with Galactus, Death, Oblivion, and Infinity) and spontaneously assumed the collective consciousness of all living things in the Universe. He is every living thing and every living thing is him; thus he controls everything in all plains of existence with the exception of the Living Tribunal, who maintains the cosmic balance of power. Eternity is the physical incarnation of time, whereas his sister Infinity represents space. Also, if Galactus ever dies or does not exist, the opposite of Eternity, Abraxas, would come into being. Eternity is guarded by Captain Universe. (taken from an old copy of the Handbook of the Marvel Universe): The origin and precise nature of the abstract being known as Eternity are unknown and unknowable. It is the sum total of collective consciousness of all living things in the universe, the embodiment of their life as Death is the embodiment of the ending of that life. Unlike Death, which Eternity refers to as it's sibling, Eternity does not often take an active hand in the dealings of the trillions of lives that make up it's total. However, since controlling the being Eternity allows the controller to wield Eternity's unlimited Powers over the beings that make it up, this entity is a target for extradimensional attackers of various abilities. Usually Eternity can deflect such attacks without significant exertion, but on occasion has had to bring it's own servants into play. While not as organized as the 'death-gods' that serve Death, these servants are usually powerful individuals, such as Doctor Strange, who may combat the attackers on their own mortal levels. These servants have a vested interest in seeing Eternity survive intact, as Eternity makes their very existance possible."

He came into control of the Thunderbolt, essentially a genie, who had to grant any wish he had.  Unfortunately, he had no command of the English language.  Most of his stories revolved around his attempts to find just the right way to phrase his requests.  Usually, he did a fair amount of destruction, before finding the words to make everything better.  When he was able to be clear, though, he was able to summon one of the most powerful forces in the DCU, capable of things that Superman could literally only dream of. |||| |||| He was forced to resign from the original JSA when his power over the Thunderbolt was greatly diminished by the High Priest of Badhnisia--ruler of the plane on which the Thunderbolt resided.  For a time, the Bolt was answering only 1/4th of his requests.  He gave his place in the JSA to Black Canary. |||| |||| Eventually the High Priest's plans were laid bare, and it became apparent that he intended to rule Badhinisia.  Casting several powerful spells to protect him from the Thunderbolt, Johnny eventually lost almost all control over the Thunderbolt.  He was able to issue one final request, though, and sent the Bolt to get Superman.  Superman (I) and his wife, Lois, were able to overcome the High Priest, and Johnny decided to remain in Badhnisia to teach its people about democracy. |||| |||| Only when that mission was complete did he return home. |||| |||| During the Silver Age, he popped up with some frequency, and tended to be seen more often on Earth 1 than not, as traveling between the two Earths was easier for him than any other character in the DCU. |||| |||| He lived through the Crisis , but was effectively retired in Badhnisia thereafter.  Eventually, after the new JSA was formed, he was aged to a point of senility and basically died.  Having found the pen in which the Thunderbolt was kept, and thus coming to be the Thunderbolt's new 'master',  Jakeem Thunder requested of his Thunderbolt that Johnny be revived.  He was, but the Bolt wasn't quite able to do it as straightforwardly as Jakeem might have wanted.  He fused Johnny and his Thunderbolt into one entity, creating Johnny Thunderbolt.  This character, restored to youth, but with a more mature personality, survives, mostly in Badhnisia, to this day.  (In a 2005 JSA arc, however, it appeared that Johnny and his Thunderbolt had gotten a 'divorce', but a full explanation has yet to be revealed.)"

211,Scarlet Witch (Marvel)(02 - Wanda Maximoff),Wanda Maximoff ,211_20090826043837_char.jpg,"Initially, the Scarlet Witch had the ability to manipulate probability via her 'hexes' (often manifesting physically as 'hex spheres' or 'hex bolts'). These hexes are relatively short range, and are limited to her line of sight. Casting a hex requires a gesture and concentration on her part, though the gestures are largely a focus for the concentration. Early in her career, her hexes were unconscious on her part, and would be automatically triggered whenever she made a particular gesture, regardless of her intent. These hexes would only manifest 'bad luck' effects. She later gained enough control over her powers that her powers only work when she wants them to, and they are not limited to negative effects. Despite this enhanced precision, her hexes are not necessarily guaranteed to work, particularly if she has been straining herself or using her powers excessively. If overextended, her hexes can backfire, causing probability to work against her wishes or to undo previous hexes. |||| |||| Her hexes have a wide, almost limitless variety of recorded and possible effects, though they often boil down to a kind of Deus Ex Machina superpower. They have been known to alter the molecular composition and physical state of physical objects, negate or distort physical laws, and to cause various forms of energy to spontaneously appear or disappear. She has a natural affinity with natural elements and phenomena, stemming largely from her magical training and origins, and has trained often at using her hexes to deflect projectiles or to cause enemies to stumble or otherwise suffer the effects of 'bad luck'. Writers often confuse her hex powers with psychokinesis, and have occasionally depicted them as able to generate energy blasts and to grant Wanda the power of flight. Although her hexes can cause objects to suddenly move or change course, they do not have the ability to 'hold on' to objects as a telekinetic might. Ultimately, the hexes are not under the Witch's direct control, although she can influence the nature of their effects with great concentration and effort. This makes her one of the few Avengers that Ultron fears; his adamantium shell cannot repel magic. She has displayed the ability to cancel Longshot and Domino's powers of probability and has also once turned Longshot into a cat. |||| |||| The first major reclassification of Wanda's fairly-indistinct hex powers came during Kurt Busiek's run on Avengers, where her mutant power was claimed by Agatha Harkness to be an ability to manipulate chaos magic, given to her by the demon Chthon (imprisoned within Wundagore Mountain) when she was born. Her hexes were, by extension, simple, indirect manifestations of this magic, destabilising probabilities by inducing chaos. Across Busiek's run, Wanda's powers grew continuously, as she gained the ability to manipulate organic matter and summon Wonder Man back to life. While in the DC Universe, she displayed the ability to access that universe's chaos magic, but had great difficulty in doing so at first, since it was more powerful there and she had no previous experience in wielding it. |||| |||| The second, current redefinition of Wanda's powers came during the Avengers Disassembled crossover event, where they were revealed to be an ability to manipulate reality. Her probability-manipulating hexes have been redefined as the conscious manifestation of this subconscious power. The idea that Wanda possessed this level of power was first suggested by Immortus during his conflict with the Avengers West Coast, although Immortus specifically claimed that Wanda could manipulate the past to influence the present. Her powers were used by Morgan Le Fey to alter reality in Avengers (volume 3) #1-3, although this was only accomplished with magical amplification. It was in Avengers Disassemled that the full extent of this power came to light, when it was revealed that Wanda had been subconsciously altering the Marvel Universe to an unknown degree for a number of years, including the reanimation of the deceased Agatha Harkness without consciously realizing it to be the case (which goes some way to retconning away the previous 'chaos magic' origin, as it was not truly Agatha who explained it, while Dr. Strange's claim that chaos magic does not exist, is contradicted by but one brief moment when he himself has employed it in the past, in a fill-in issue, during an era where he was using 'catastrophe magic'.)This retconning has caused much debate and disgust in the comic fandom recently. |||| |||| This aspect of her power is not under her conscious control, and continues even after Dr. Strange shut down her mind. There doesn't seem to be any limits to her powers as she was easily able to alter the entire 616 reality to create the House of M, and is also altering reality on a multiversal scale without even realizing it! |||| |||| The source of Wanda's reality manipulation powers is due to the fact that her mutation allows her to tap into magic. This was confirmed in Avengers Disassembled by Dr Strange, and by Dark Beast in Excalibur, who said that magic is just another way of manipulating forces on a quantum level. It has been suggested that Wanda's powers have been influenced by the demonic magician Chthon: in particular, that Chthon's own magic redefined Wanda's power to have a similar function, although this remains dubious, having been claimed by the faux Harkness.",,"Daughter of the original Scarlet Witch (Natalya Maximoff), twin sister of Quicksilver."

His mother died in childbirth, earning him the enduring hatred of his adopted elder brother, Hunter, who also resented T'Challa for supplanting him in the royal household. Hunter would become the White Wolf, leader of the Hatut Zeraze (Dogs of War), the Wakandan secret police. Their father T'Chaka remarried, but his second wife, Ramonda, seemingly ran away with another man when T'Challa was eight. When T'Challa was a teenager, T'Chaka was murdered by Klaw, a Dutchman seeking to plunder the rare Vibranium metal unique to Wakanda, but T'Challa used Klaw's own weapon to maim him and drive him off. T'Challa studied in Europe and America, then underwent ritual trials in Wakanda - including defeating his uncle S'yan, the existing Black Panther - to win the heart-shaped herb, enhancing his abilities and linking him spiritually to the Panther God Bast. Now Wakanda's ruler as the Black Panther, he disbanded and exiled the Hatut Zeraze and continued transforming his country into a high-tech wonderland. When tribal war broke out, T'Challa restored peace by condemning the Jabari tribe, and by picking Dora Milaje ('Adored Ones') from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. |||| |||| Taught by his father to think two steps ahead of enemies and three steps ahead of friends, T'Challa saw the world's super-beings as potential threats to Wakanda. Inviting the Fantastic Four to visit him, he forced them into a series of tests, then allied with them against a returning Klaw. He also joined the American-based Avengers to spy on them from within, but soon came to regard them as true friends and staunch allies. He adopted the identity of teacher Luke Charles while in America, romancing singer Monica Lynne, later his fiancée. Dividing his time between Wakanda and America for years, he battled foes such as Jabari malcontent M'Baku the Man-Ape, rebel leader Erik Killmonger, the snake-charmer Venomm (later an ally), voodoo charlatan Baron Macabre, the Ku Klux Klan, the ghostly Soul-Strangler, the soaring Wind Eagle, mutated drug czar Solomon Prey, arms dealer Moses Magnum and the Supremacists of Azania. He also fought Kiber the Cruel during a quest for the mystic time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs; these produced an alternate version of T'Challa from a future ten years hence, a merry telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm. Placing his dying future self in cryogenic storage, T'Challa broke off his engagement with Monica since he feared he had no future to give her. Wakanda and Atlantis subsequently came to the brink of war during the Kiber Island incident, which revealed Wakanda to be a nuclear power. Discovering his stepmother Ramonda had not run away, but instead had been kidnapped by Anton Pretorius, he rescued her from years of captivity in South Africa. T'Challa joined the Knights of Pendragon against their enemies, the Bane, learning in the process that he housed one of the Pendragon spirits himself. He was also used as a pawn in the efforts of the munitions company Cardinal Technology to escalate the civil war in the northern nation Mohannda, but exposed Cardinal with the aid of the mercenary Black Axe and the anti-war activist Afrikaa. |||| |||| T'Challa's restrictions on exports of both Vibranium and Wakandan technology had long annoyed foreign powers. Xcon, an alliance of rogue intelligence agents and the Russian mafia, backed a coup in Wakanda led by Reverend Achebe. Learning Achebe was empowered by the demon Mephisto, T'Challa sold his soul in exchange for Mephisto's, abandoning Achebe and leaving Wakanda in peace; however, T'Challa's unity with the Panther God and its link to the spirits of past Panther Clan leaders forced Mephisto to forfeit the Panther's soul. T'Challa then presented the U.N. with evidence of the Xcon plot and its U.S. links, demanding sanctions against America. When Hunter and the Hatut Zeraze resurfaced during the Xcon incident, a wary T'Challa imprisoned them just prior to regaining his throne. |||| |||| After T'Challa discharged Nakia from the Dora Milaje for trying to kill Monica Lynne in a fit of jealousy, Nakia was tortured by Achebe and rehabilitated by Killmonger, who shaped her into the mad warrior Malice. She was replaced in the Dora Milaje by Queen Divine Justice, an American-raised Jabari. T'Challa himself returned to the U.S. on a diplomatic mission, leaving his Washington envoy Everett K. Ross in charge as regent of Wakanda, until Killmonger tried to destroy Wakanda's economy; to thwart this, the Panther nationalized all foreign companies in Wakanda, causing a global run on the stock market, which Tony Stark (Iron Man) used to secure a controlling interest in the Wakandan Design Group. Returning home, the Panther fought Killmonger in ritual combat, but was distracted at a critical juncture by Ross and beaten nearly to death. Killmonger only relented when Ross, still regent, yielded on T'Challa's behalf, unwittingly giving the Black Panther title to Killmonger. T'Challa's life was mystically saved by his allies Brother Voodoo and Moon Knight. While T'Challa recovered, Killmonger tried to join the Avengers as the new Black Panther, and Achebe enlisted super-mercenaries such as Deadpool to attack Wakanda again. During the resultant Avengers visit to Wakanda, Ross freed Hunter, whose scheming resulted in Killmonger's seeming demise and the restoration of T'Challa's title. |||| |||| Wakanda next came into conflict with Deviant Lemuria during a dispute over custody of a Deviant child found in Wakanda. As tensions mounted, warships from Wakanda, the U.S. and Atlantis all entered the area, and Hunter made matters worse when he decided to force T'Challa to 'reclaim his dignity' by reviving Klaw, who tried to spark outright war between the nations involved. In the end, Ross's negotiation skills and information supplied by Magneto and Doctor Doom resolved the conflict. While T'Challa faced attacks by Malice, Divine Justice was kidnapped by the Man-Ape, who learned she was the rightful Queen of his tribe. T'Challa defeated M'Baku again, though not before he uncovered the frozen future Panther. Back in New York, the criminal Nightshade resurrected the fabled Chinese monster Chiantang the Black Dragon to use against T'Challa. Black Dragon had the Panther attacked by a mind-controlled Iron Fist, whose assault caused the brain aneurysm the future Panther had foreshadowed. Nightshade, meanwhile, managed to revive the future Panther. |||| |||| At the same time, T'Challa learned that White Wolf had taken over Xcon and slain most of its leaders, who had used King Solomon's Frogs to replace the U.S. President and Canadian Prime Minister with brainwashed future counterparts, allowing Xcon to secretly take over both countries. Hunter continued their plan and sought revenge on Tony Stark for his buy-out of Wakandan Design Group. Uncertain of how far along Hunter's plan was, T'Challa drew Stark out with a covert message, using financial finagling to seize control of Stark Enterprises and simultaneously annex a small Canadian island in Lake Superior, prompting the U.S. and Canadian leaders to meet to discuss this crisis. The Panther and his allies, including the future Panther, then invaded the White House and foiled Xcon's plot, un-brainwashing the duplicate leaders and returning them to their own times. |||| |||| Panther and his allies returned to Wakanda, where the future Panther fell into a coma. Hoping to free her tribe, Divine Justice freed the Man-Ape, but he broke his promises of non-violence by slaying the helpless future T'Challa. The original T'Challa, by now unstable and hallucinating, attacked the Jabari tribe with the intent of wiping them out; but after nearly slaying Divine Justice, he came to his senses and stopped the battle. Unable to face what he had done, the Panther handed power to his council and hid in New York. There he mentored policeman Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience which gave T'Challa the strength to face his illness, his nation and the world. His rule has since been challenged by a revived Killmonger, an issue which remains unresolved. At the same time, T'Challa renewed his ties with the Avengers, helping them battle Scorpio, secure special United Nations status and unmask U.S. Defense Secretary Dell Rusk as the evil Red Skull; however, the team disbanded after a series of devastating assaults by an insane Scarlet Witch. |||| |||| T'Challa recently fell in love with, and married Ororo Monroe, the mutant X-Man known as Storm."

He was confronted by Captain America, the Falcon, and Nick Fury, cornered, and accidentally shot into space. |||| |||| The Gargoyle found himself trapped aboard a satellite in Earth’s orbit, where the subversive scientific organization Advanced Idea Mechanics rescued him. On their behalf, he joined their efforts to launch a satellite with heavy weaponry, fighting Captain America and Spider-Man, but was accidentally rocketed into space once more. In deep space, he was retrieved by the Bird of Prey, a pirate starship whose crew members were of various alien races. Ever out for himself, the Grey Gargoyle forced himself into command of the ship. |||| |||| The Bird of Prey encountered the starship StarJammer, used by Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three in their adventure to the Doomsday Star. The Gargoyle had the heroes captured and conscripted to join the crew for slave labor. The heroes’ ally, the Recorder, not only helped his friends escape but started a mutiny among the crew against the Grey Gargoyle. When the rebellion grew out of control, the Grey Gargoyle professed to want to join Thor in order to return to Earth. However, at the height of the battle, the Gargoyle tried to flee and seemed to have died in a violent explosion. |||| |||| In fact, Duval survived by created a stone-like cocoon around himself. Using the cocoon to travel through space, he managed to return to Earth, where he immediately battled the Avengers. In the process, his cocoon was destroyed, and he was taken into police custody. Duval was soon freed by villains of the fourth Masters of Evil organization, whose goal was to destroy the Avengers, but following a defeat at the hands of the Wasp and Black Knight, he was again returned to jail. |||| |||| Having broken out, Duval embarked on a unique plan. He created an artistic persona, Paul St. Pierre, and became a successful and highly sought-after sculptor. In fact, his statues were real people, transformed by his power and sealed with a special polymer compound that would make this change permanent. His plot was uncovered when Tony Stark attended his gallery, and he exposed the Gargoyle. |||| |||| The Grey Gargoyle was broken out of prison again, this time to join several master criminals in a coordinated attack on various heroes and sent to battle the Hulk. At the time, the Hulk possessed a gray alter-ego, and this confused Duval, who had thought that the Hulk had turned to stone but nonetheless kept moving. The Hulk summarily defeated the Gargoyle, breaking his arm, and left. The Grey Gargoyle continued to be a recurring villain in the lives of many heroes, battling the likes of Captain America and Spider-Man as part of Doctor Doom’s “Doom’s Brigade,” fighting She-Hulk, and being accosted by the Black Widow. In the latter case, the Widow claimed a self-appointed mission to track down and destroy all of the Avengers’ former enemies, and she seemed to obliterate the Grey Gargoyle, blasting his stone form into pieces. |||| |||| Later, Duval, somehow recovering from his previous encounter, was contacted by the Gideon Trust, a business executive board interested in using technology developed by the Fantastic Four for their own purposes. They bade the Grey Gargoyle to attack the Thing, in a sort of initiation to their employ. The Gargoyle seemed successful in turning the Thing into non-living stone, but he was defeated by the remaining members of the Fantastic Four. In addition, the Thing was able to break free of the Gargoyle’s power as it kick-started his ability to transform into his human alter-ego and back again at will. |||| |||| Paul Duval returned to his initial goal of searching for Thor’s secret to immortality when the death of a childhood friend affected him significantly. He attacked Thor Girl, Thor’s associate Tarene, and actually managed to defeat her, leaving her for dead and stealing her magical hammer. Proclaiming himself to now be like a god, the Gargoyle was immediately confronted by Desak the God-Slayer who was searching for Thor. Desak defeated the Gargoyle with ease. |||| |||| He was next seen serving time at Pym Experimental Penitentiary Number One, a prison that kept its super-powered inmates miniaturized, and participated in a breakout led by the Mad Thinker only to be thwarted by She-Hulk."

5813,Psycho-Man (Marvel),,5813_20151124094754_char.jpg,"Psycho-Man usually depended on armor and weapons. He has sometimes stated that he derives power from the emotions he causes, like a psychic vampire. He recently gained some of the powers of his Control Box, as well as the ability to generate solid energy forms to give substance to his illusions. |||| |||| Psycho-Man wears a variety of body armors (or uses robot-versions of himself), demonstrating superhuman physical powers; some are giant-sized or possess other offensive powers. He traveled throughout the Microverse in an immense World Ship, and has the means to travel to and from Earth or other dimensions. He has created androids able to pass as human, alter their appearances, and manipulate emotions. |||| |||| Psycho-Man has great intelligence and mathematical genius, as well as extensive knowledge of technology far in advance of present-day Earth's.",,"The Chief Scientist and ruler of the technocracy governing the five planets of the Sub-Atomica system within the Microverse (a reality accessed via the energies of shrinking), Psycho-Man discovered the secrets of fear itself with the guidance of the Earth goddess Nox. When his system became overcrowded, he sought a new home for his people and chose Earth, whose population he believed had no defense against his weaponry. He created a human-sized armored suit and Control Box. Unable to transport a weapon large enough to affect the entire planet, he employed several criminals whom he kept in line via his Control Box-Ivan, Live Wire, and Shell-Shock-successfully gathering the materials to construct his large Control weapon. However, the land he used as his base had been recently purchased as Panther Island by the Black Panther. With the help of the Inhumans, the Black Panther fought with him and bested his partners. Then, with the appearance of the Human Torch, Thing, Triton, and Lockjaw, they fought him directly, but were stalled by his massive psycho ray that kept them at bay with their greatest fears. But Gorgon arrived moments later and discovered the ruse and helped his friends escape and destroy the gun; and in a final battle, the Black Panther snuck up behind Psycho-Man and grabbed him, where-in he disappeared again into the Microverse. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, the Human Torch, Thing, and Mister Fantastic entered the Microverse seeking the Silver Surfer to prevent Galactus from consuming Earth. Detecting their presence, Psycho-Man sent his Indestructible robot to capture them, but the Silver Surfer wiped it from existence before returning to Earth. Psycho-Man then transported the Fantastic Four members aboard his ship and sent a number of armored forms against them; however, the heroes trapped Psycho-Man and convinced him that Galactus posed a threat to his world as well, and he returned them to Earth. Soon after, Sub-Atomica was overrun by the invading Insectivorids of Annihilus. Psycho-Man captured the Surfer to power his energy weapons and Spider-Man to probe his mind for the means of driving off the insect swarm, but they escaped back to Earth. Annihilus was eventually driven off. |||| |||| Apparently exiled by his people, Psycho-Man retreated to his Worldship, employing androids to clear space debris around him. Though remaining a man of science, he came to worship gods of Chaos. Psycho-Man also reclaimed his armor from the Fantastic Four, which led them to pursue him back to the Microverse. Meanwhile, Arcturus Rann and the Micronauts were attacked by his androids and followed them back to Psycho-Man's ship. There the teams joined forces to thwart Psycho-Man's plot to conquer the universe, though the Microversian Insectivorid, Jasmine, was slain by one of Psycho-Man's creatures. |||| |||| Psycho-Man later easily conquered Mirwood, the Microverse planet of Princess Pearla, seeking to seize the metal from its Mines of Nuvidia, which provided immunity to his emotion-control. He then returned to Earth, using an artificial being as his Hate-Monger, fanning bigotry and hatred into violent chaos across New York City, and transforming the Invisible Girl into his pawn Malice, Mistress of Hate. The Hate-Monger was destroyed by the villain-killing Scourge of the Underworld, and the Fantastic Four restored Malice to her right mind. The Fantastic Four pursued Psycho-Man to Mirwood where, despite being initially captured and duped into believing they had been trapped at tiny size, they overpowered him. Confronting her tormentor, Sue Richards usurped his Control Box, subjecting him to all three emotions at maximum intensity, leaving him a withered husk and collapsing his autonomic nervous system. Allegedly requiring artificial support to survive, he sent a robot duplicate to Earth some time later, but it was easily defeated by Fantastic Four clones created by Aron the Rogue Watcher. Psycho-Man then managed to shrink the entire Sub-Atomica system and held it hostage on his worldship until they acknowledged him as their ruler again. Lacking the power to restore the system to true size, he sought out the cosmic Uni-Power (briefly granted to beings to become Captain Universe), summoning Spider-Man and a number of its other past possessors to the Microverse. Finding Spider-Man and the rest bereft of those energies, Psycho-Man imprisoned them, but they broke free; subjected to an overload of his own shrink-ray by Spider-Man, Psycho-Man vanished from existence. |||| |||| After the apparent death of Mr. Fantastic, Psycho-Man plotted vengeance against the Invisible Woman, reconquering Mirwood and using Pearla to dupe the Fantastic Four into believing that Mr. Fantastic was in the Microverse. The Fantastic Four's newest member, Ant-Man (Scott Lang), exposed Psycho-Man's involvement, and the seemingly invalid villain blew up his own base in an effort to slay his foes, though they escaped. Surviving as well, Psycho-Man occupied the facilities of Baron Karza, a Microverse tyrant then believed dead. Psycho-Man sought the future technology of the cyborg Garrison Kane (Weapon X) to enhance the power of the Baron's Dog Soldiers, leading to a conflict with Kane's allies Cable, Domino (Neena Thurman), and Copycat, as well as Arcturus Rann, Marionette, and Bug. Cable used his psychic powers to bombard Psycho-Man with the powerful love emotions existing between Kane and Copycat, incapacitating the villain, who was left in stasis under the Rann's' supervision. |||| |||| When the Stark-Fujikawa Corporation somehow acquired one of Psycho-Man's armored suits and Control Boxes, Dr. Bradley Beynon used them to seek vengeance on Reed Richards, whom Beynon felt had stolen his ideas. The real Psycho-Man confronted him to retrieve his property, but both he and Beynon were sent back to the Microverse by a malfunctioning shrink ray. When the Silver Surfer pursued the extradimensional Tenebrae into the Microverse, Psycho-Man captured them both. The Surfer broke free, but Psycho-Man then joined with Tenebrae to capture the Silver Surfer and use him to power his ship as they plotted to conquer Earth; however, Tenebrae's former associates in the group-mind of the Mergence attacked them, and Psycho-Man narrowly escaped back to his own realm. When Sub-Atomica's existence appeared to be threatened by energies from Earth, Psycho-Man traced them back to the young mutant Hope (Esperanza Ling), and he attempted to claim her power for himself. Hope was protected by Spider-Man, the alien Technarch Warlock, and the telepath Psimon, so Psycho-Man transported them back to his ship where his more powerful weapon nearly drove them all mad. The panicked Hope's technology-disrupting power nearly destroyed his ship, and Psycho-Man was forced to admit defeat and send the heroes home. |||| |||| Shortly thereafter, all of the Microverse-type realms were merged during a conflict between the mad Titan Thanos and the revived Baron Karza. Around that time, Fredd, the alternate-dimension evil twin clone future self of Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell), was banished from his reality in an energy cocoon by his world's Reed Richards. He arrived in the Microverse, where his power was detected by Psycho-Man, who enlisted Drax the Destroyer to shatter the cocoon. Once freed, Fredd proved immune to the power of Psycho-Man, whom he dominated, and he captured Earth-616 (mainstream Earth)'s Captain Marvel to test Psycho-Man's enlarging ray's ability to restore him to Earth. Captain Marvel took control of Fredd's Nega-Bands and tapped into Psycho-Man's Control Box, driving Fredd into a frenzy that culminated with his exploding Psycho-Man's World Ship. |||| Psycho-Man finally began to succumb to the nerve degeneration initiated by Sue Richards' attack. Dying, he returned to Earth to gain vengeance on his greatest enemies. His powers enhanced to a new degree, he caused the Fantastic Four to be evicted from the Baxter Building, taking it as his own base. From there he spread his power across Manhattan, causing increasing levels of terror, violence, and depression. Sue, however, was able not only to sense his power, but to manipulate his energies, purging the city of them. Using the blind Alicia Masters as a double to catch Psycho-Man unaware, Sue knocked him out by obstructing his airway, and he was placed in stasis."

80832,Loni Stane (Marvel)(Earth-55921),,,,,"Loni was a greedy opportunist, always on the lookout for a man who could provide her with a life of wealth and privilege. She found such a man in industrialist Howard Stark. The two were married and they remained together until Howard's company, the Stark Defense Corporation, began suffering financially. This was due largely to Howard's investment in Biotech Armor, whose untested processes caused Stark's stock to plummet. Fearing for her future, Loni divorced Stark and took half of his assets in the settlement and then began sleeping with Zebediah Stane, Stark's chief competitor. Loni (being a gold digger) agreed with Stane in taking Stark's company apart (Howard was most likely too distracted as his second wife gave birth their son). Later, Loni had her and Stane's son. |||| |||| After Stane was sent to prison for kidnapping Stark's young son, Loni divorced Stane and acquired even more money from the settlement. Sometime later, she meets a teenage Tony Stark and his friend James Rhodes as well as seeing the younger Stark's prototype armor. She later pleaded with her ex-husband to provide Obadiah Stane (her son) with a secure education via a stay at the government think tank known as the Baxter Building. |||| |||| Later, Tony thinks it was Loni that's the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them and set off to Utah to find Loni. When they arrive, Obadiah falls off a cliff but Tony (in his prototype Iron Man armor) catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni and their hideout. When Tony breaks into the compound, Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Stark saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards (because she wanted no witnesses), Loni confesses to the elder Stark that all she ever wanted was power. That’s why she married Howard, divorced him, married Zebadiah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebadiah killed. |||| |||| Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. After Tony takes off his armor, Loni says she wondered what it was like if she stayed with Howard, had given him a child, and if she had been Tony's mother. Then, Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to Howard. Obadiah, mad that Loni (his mother) abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her."
9609,Ringer (Marvel)(01 - Anthony Davis),Anthony Davis ,9609_20070302020059_char.jpg,,,"A former engineer for NASA, criminal Anthony Davis grew jealous of the wealthy Kyle Richmond. Designing a suit of battle armor that would be constructed by the Tinkerer, Davis, calling himself the Ringer, broke into one of Richmond's buildings to rob it. Richmond confronted the Ringer in his guise of Nighthawk II, breaking several of Davis's teeth in the process. Davis was arrested and jailed, where it took a prison dentist several weeks to rebuild his broken teeth. |||| |||| Humiliated by his defeat at Nighthawk's hands, Davis decided he was not cut out for a life of crime. He had previously designed an improved version of his old battlesuit, which remained in the Tinkerer's warehouse, which he planned to rent out to various criminal contacts as part of a get-rich-quick scheme. As Davis tested the suit, the Beetle broke into the shop to retrieve his own equipment. Easily subduing the Ringer, the Beetle brought him back to his hideout, where he forced Davis to wear the suit to battle Spider-Man, tricking him into thinking a new Ring the Beetle had added to the suit would explode if the Ringer did not obey. the Ringer teamed up with Coachwhip and Killer Shrike to attack the Moon Knight during the Acts of Vengeance, but he was defeated quickly. |||| |||| The Ringer, deathly afraid of battling another superhero, was dealt a humiliating defeat by Spider-Man, who broke his repaired dental work and left him webbed for the police. Upon his release from prison, the Ringer avoided New York City and its super heroes and operated as a costumed criminal primarily in the Midwest, sinking into petty crime and being viewed as a loser in the supervillain community. On a visit to the Bar With No Name in Medina County, Ohio, one of a number of similar secret meeting places for costumed criminals, the Ringer was contacted by Gary Gilbert, who was formerly the costumed terrorist called Firebrand. Gilbert invited the Ringer to attend a meeting at the bar to discuss strategies for dealing with Scourge, the mysterious vigilante who had murdered a large number of costumed criminals. The Ringer came to the meeting, but, unfortunately for him, so did Scourge, disguised as the bartender. Scourge slaughtered the Ringer and all the other criminals who were present. |||| |||| Upon hearing of his supposed death, the Ringer's wife Leila Davis became a criminal herself, plotting to get revenge on the Beetle, who she blamed for her husband's humiliation, although she was thwarted by Spider-Man. When she joined a group of other villains in attempting to kill the wall-crawler, she was saved during the battle by her husband, who appeared as the cyborg Strikeback. Davis revealed that he had not actually died in the Scourge's massacre, but was barely alive when AIM agents investigated the murder, seeking information on the technology used by the dead criminals. AIM created a new cyborg body for him, and he worked for the organization for some time before striking out on his own. As Strikeback, Davis was a much more skilled fighter than he was as the Ringer, defeating Boomerang, Swarm, the Vulture and Stegron. However, the dinosaur man badly damaged Strikeback's cybernetic systems during the battle, which caused them to slowly break down. During this time, he enjoyed a happy, if brief, retirement with Leila before dying. Leila herself would later perish in battle with the villain Graviton."

Hussar was one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the team of superhuman Earthling mutants known as the X-Men over the fate of Phoenix, a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey. |||| |||| Hussar was later amongst those Imperial Guard members who allied themselves with the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after the ploy was discovered, Hussar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Hussar was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, during the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Hussar was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended Lilandra, who had since regained the throne, against the Kree super-team known as Starforce.

Jacob Fury's Scorpio android then impersonated him and infiltrated the original, human Zodiac organization. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias Taurus. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. |||| |||| Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. In their initial foray, the Avengers failed, although several androids were destroyed. Sagittarius, in particular, was destroyed and replaced with an LMD replica of the Avengers’ Hawkeye. Hawkeye's LMD was used to infiltrate the Avengers' headquarters, and Scorpio also made a Leo LMD in the form of the Avengers’ Tigra for additional infiltration. This new Leo LMD helped the Zodiac gain an upper hand when the Avengers tracked the Zodiac to their refuge in Death Valley, California, but the first android Leo took offence at being replaced. He battled Scorpio directly, seemingly destroying him. |||| |||| The Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key's native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found Hawkeye and Tigra had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them."

7635,Overthrow (DC),Arnold Beck ,7635_20110904164840_char.jpg,"Overthrow wears a stylized cesta on his left hand, which is based on the curved wicker basket used in the sport of jai alai.  Unlike the true cesta, which is designed to catch and hurl a hard rubber ball, Overthrow's own metallic cesta generates glowing balls of explosive energy which he can hurl over great distances with pinpoint accuracy.  When not in use, Overthrow's cesta flips back to become part of his gauntlet.",,"Arnold Beck was an embittered employee let go from Kord Omniversal (the corporation run by Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle) who came to believe that he was just a victim of the machinations of the military-industrial complex, of which Kord's company was a prime element. He acquired a power-suit of armor, and a stylized weapon resembling a cesta-punta used in the game of jai alai which hurled explosives, and set about to demolish Kord's main facilities; this naturally brought him into conflict with the Blue Beetle, who handily defeated him. |||| |||| During the Millennium Affair, which saw a Guardian of the Universe and a Zamaron journey to Earth to help ten human beings become agents of evolutionary change, the intergalactic group known as the Manhunters threw all of its efforts into ending their program and neutralizing Earth's heroes from providing any assistance. Dozens of heroes found themselves confronted by loved ones, friends, employees, and allies who revealed themselves to be secret Manhunters who had reported back to their superiors over the years on their target's activities. Unusually, no such act of betrayal had struck the Blue Beetle, and he began to vigorously seek out just who 'his' Manhunter might be. He at first suspected that a corrupt Hub City police captain who had been blackmailing him with the knowledge of his secret identity was the Manhunter assigned to him, but this turned out to be merely a coincidental act; the Beetle was then confronted by Overthrow, who revealed himself to be the Manhunter assigned to report on him and neutralize him, if necessary. It had been the Manhunters who had provided Beck with his armor and helped him create the Overthrow identity, and on their orders he had attempted to contain and impede the Blue Beetle's activities. Beetle once again defeated Overthrow, however, and after the complete and utter defeat of Earth's Manhunters by the combined heroes of Earth (in which battle Overthrow also fought on the Manhunters' behalf) he disappeared. |||| |||| Overthrow was for some time living in the 'supervillain' nation of Zandia, the former desmesne of Brother Blood's Church of Blood. Overthrow was part of Zandia's Olympic team, which was made up largely of supervillains. |||| |||| During the events of the OMAC Project, Overthrow was in Moscow battling Rocket Red Dimitri Pushkin, the former JLI/JLE member. (Pushkin's predecessor in the JLI, Rocket Red #7 Vladimir Mikoyan, had been one of Beck's fellow Manhunters, who had revealed himself to the League and was destroyed in battle with them.) He was then targeted by the new head of Checkmate, Maxwell Lord. Lord dispatched an OMAC to attack Overthrow, and the cyborg swiftly cut the supervillain down, killing him."

1275,Galactus (Marvel),Galan ,1275_20060316175911_char.jpg,,"It can be argued that with such staggering might and vast intellect, Galactus is prone to over-confidence and underestimation of his foes, as he has often been defeated by lesser beings. |||| ||||","Rebirth |||| Originally named Galan of the planet Taa, Galactus is the sole survivor of the Big Crunch of the universe that existed prior to the current Marvel Universe. |||| |||| Galan was a space explorer investigating the impending end of his universe. His original intent was to discover a means to protect his planet from radiation that was destroying all life in the universe, but he was unable to do so. Eventually, most of Taa was engulfed and rendered dead. As Galan approached the Cosmic Egg, the focal point of the Big Crunch and the source of the life-destroying radiation, his ship and crew were promptly destroyed. At the moment Galan's universe met its end, the incarnation of that reality's Phoenix Force amassed the positive emotions of all living beings in the cosmos to preserve them from eternal damnation, enabling the Sentience of the Universe — the previous universe's incarnation of Eternity — to meet with Galan. Within the Cosmic Egg the Sentience of the Universe revealed itself to Galan and informed him that though they both would die in the impending cataclysm, they would survive through a joint heir born into the next universe. The Sentience of the Universe then merged itself with the mortal Galan, establishing Galan as the sole survivor of the ensuing Big Crunch. This union ultimately led to his rebirth in the current universe as Galactus. |||| |||| After the Big Bang of the current universe, to complete his metamorphosis, Galactus was encased in a cocoon of enormous cosmic energies. After millions of years, he emerged as an entity of vast cosmic power who was also necessary for the existence of the newly formed universe. |||| |||| Galactus is considered one of the five essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside Eternity, Death, Infinity, and Oblivion. Galactus has been referred to as the 'third force of the universe' and 'one corner of that great triangle which is the universe' by Eternity and Death, respectively. Eternity and Death each consider Galactus a peer and a sibling, with Death actually referring to Galactus as 'husband, father, brother, and son.' |||| |||| |||| The Devourer of Worlds |||| Galactus requires unknown energies obtainable only from certain types of planets in order to sustain his life. The suitable type of planet need not be one where life is present, but it must have the potential to support life. Galactus usually employs a herald to scout the universe for those suitable types of planets. When the suitable planet is found, Galactus will usually land on the planet's surface and assemble his Elemental Converter, a colossal machine capable of draining all life energy from the planet within minutes. Galactus has been known to devour planets without the aid of his Elemental Converter on occasion, but the device makes the process more efficient. Galactus, seeing himself as a higher being, usually will not avoid a suitable planet simply because it is home to sentient life. Thus, over billions of years he has become one of the most feared beings in the universe, his vast power allowing him to lay waste to innumerable extra-terrestrial civilizations in his quest for sustenance. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he is not an evil being, but rather a force of nature whose feedings are necessary for survival. It is known that Galactus plays a necessary role in the continuum of the Marvel Universe, bringing balance between the two opposing universal forces of Death and Eternity; who are in essence the Yin and Yang of the Marvel universe. Eternity has stated that the universe would fail, falling into stasis then collapsing without Galactus' presence to balance it. It has been suggested by some that his purpose in the universe is to devour planets that have reached an evolutionary peak, although alternative information suggests that he will create a whole new universe at the end of this one, a universe which will be immeasurably greater than the total of the planets he has devoured; thus giving back far more than he has ever taken. |||| |||| |||| Heralds |||| Galactus has appointed a number of entities as his heralds, imbuing them with a minuscule portion of his Power Cosmic and sending them to search for edible worlds. Most of his heralds have either rebelled against him, betrayed him or been cast aside for some reason. |||| |||| Among his heralds are the Fallen One, Silver Surfer, Terrax, Firelord, Air-Walker, the Air-Walker robot, an Earthwoman named Frankie Raye later known as Nova, Morg, Red Shift, the Asgardian Destroyer armor, Human Torch, and Stardust. Gladiator and Tyrant were possibly heralds. |||| |||| In stories in alternate and parallel realities, Galactus also used other heralds: Plasma, Dark Angel, Superman, Dazzler, Golden Oldie, the Fantastic Four, Thor, Ardina, Starglow and Dominas. |||| |||| In the Ultimate Marvel storyline Gah Lak Tus, as he is known in the Ultimate Universe, has used the Ultimate version of the Silver Surfer as a herald as well. The ultimate version of the Vision was built as a warning system for the coming of Gah Lak Tus. |||| |||| |||| Attempts to Devour the Earth |||| Galactus has threatened to destroy the Earth on several occasions. On the first, the Fantastic Four (aided by the Watcher Uatu and by Galactus' rebellious herald, the Silver Surfer) defeated him by threatening him with the Ultimate Nullifier. Galactus vowed to never again try to harm the Earth. |||| |||| Nevertheless, he has returned on several occasions, in one instance weakened enough for the Fantastic Four, the Avengers and Doctor Strange to defeat him. Rather than watch him die of hunger, Mister Fantastic saved him, for which Galactus called him 'friend,' and vowed Earth need never again fear Galactus, and for which Mr Fantastic was later put on galactic trial by the Shi'Ar. |||| |||| |||| Temporary Death |||| In the Galactus: The Devourer limited series (1999-2000), Galactus — starving to death due to his addiction to the life forces of living beings which offer him no sustenance — was seemingly killed after a battle against the united forces of the Silver Surfer, Avengers, Fantastic Four, Jean Grey, Starjammers, the Shi'ar Empire and an armada of other united planets (including even a Kree starship) when his own Elemental Converter was turned against him. He died with an ominous warning that his death would allow a great evil to surface. After his death, Galactus' true form was revealed, that of a sentient star. |||| |||| That great evil emerged in Fantastic Four Annual 2001 in the form of Abraxas, the universal embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity. It was revealed that most of the energy that Galactus takes from planets was devoted to keeping him imprisoned. If released, Abraxas would eventually destroy the entire multiverse. Abraxas was defeated only after it was revealed in Fantastic Four (vol. 2) #49 (vol. 1) #478; January 2002) that Galactus was not truly dead but in his incorporeal star form he would be forever unable to rein in his energies and reclaim form. Franklin Richards and Valeria Von Doom pooled their vast, Celestial-level powers and reconstituted Galactus, but permanently burned out their powers in the revival. Once reconstituted, Galactus easily reclaimed the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas and Reed Richards used it to remake the multiverse into one in which Abraxas never escaped. It was in this issue that the Ultimate Nullifier was revealed to be an aspect of Galactus himself. |||| |||| |||| 'Rising Storm' |||| In the 2005 Fantastic Four storyline Rising Storm, Reed Richards built a weapon that was designed to strip Galactus of the Power Cosmic - this was made possible due to input from Johnny Storm who was cosmically aware at the time. Johnny Storm, as Invisible Man - Herald of Galactus, managed to keep Galactus occupied long enough for Reed and Quasar to complete construction of the weapon. The weapon actually succeeded in separating the two aspects that comprise Galactus, thus Galan was freed from the Power Cosmic and reduced to his mortal, humanoid form. In tribute to 'the indomitable spirit of the humanoid order', Galan willingly exiled himself into an other-universal realm, with the hope that this act would delay the Power Cosmic in finding him. |||| |||| This did not last long, however, and as Galactus, he encountered Beta Ray Bill in the Stormbreaker mini-series shortly after. The manner in which the Power Cosmic found Galan and reformed Galactus was never revealed. |||| |||| |||| Annihilation |||| In the Annihilation: Silver Surfer miniseries, written by Keith Giffen, it was revealed that Galactus was not always the sole member of the 'Cosmic Balance'; it has been suggested that Galactus was but one of several beings similar to himself. Due to differing opinions of the powers they had been blessed with, the Balance all but destroyed itself in civil war, with only three remaining - Galactus the Devourer of Worlds, Tenebrous of the Darkness Between, and Aegis the Lady of All Sorrows. Able to subdue his darker brethren in the first Kyln, Galactus remained the only extant member of the Balance, until the Annihilation Wave ruptured the Crunch, freeing Tenebrous and Aegis. Knowing of their escape, Galactus has augmented the Silver Surfer, who is in his employ as Herald once more, and has stated that Tenebrous and Aegis will move against him, indicating awareness. In Annihilation #1, Tenebrous and Aegis seemingly defeat the Silver Surfer and Galactus. In the subsequent issue, the incapacitated Galactus and Silver Surfer are revealed as captives in Thanos' starship, where Annihilus has tasked Thanos with discovering the secret of the Power Cosmic. Annihilation #3 finds Galactus in an unconscious state, while Thanos has harnessed Galactus' cosmic might to utilize him as a weapon of destruction on a large scale. In Annihilation #4, Thanos attempts to release Galactus from his bonds, as the Titan discovers that Annihilus plans to use Galactus as a cosmic bomb to destroy all life in both the 616-universe and the Negative Zone. As he works to free Galactus, Thanos remarks that he would teleport away once the planet eater was released, as he would not want to be on the receiving end of devourer's wrath. However, Thanos meets an untimely end at the hands of Drax the Destroyer before he can release Galactus. ||||"

However, a mobster threw a grenade into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider. McNider thought his days as a surgeon were over until one day, as he was recovering, an owl crashed through his window (remeniscent of the incident that inspired Batman to dress as a bat). Taking off the bandages that were covering his eyes, he found that he could see, but only in perfect darkness. Using his newfound ability, he developed a special visor that let him see in light and 'blackout bombs' that block out all light, and used these to fight crime. He adopted the owl, Hooty, and appointed him as his sidekick. He later joined the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron."

He also possessed superhuman senses, most notably his vision and hearing. His senses were said to be so acute that he could hear sap running through trees and see events occurring miles away. Heimdall also briefly possessed the Odinpower, which granted him the power to channel cosmic energies.",,"Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard. Heimdall, the eternally vigilant. Heimdall the immovable. |||| |||| *** ORIGIN *** |||| Heimdall was born gifted with senses so acute that they border on the extrasensory. An Asgardian, he proved himself an extraordinary warrior. With frequent invasion and war brought to Asgard from Storm Giants and Frost Giants among other threats Odin would seek a guard for the Bifrost bridge. Due to his natural gifts of vision, sight, and hearing, Heimdall was appointed as guardian of Asgard's Bifrost Bridge by Odin, after fierce competition from fellow Asgardian warriors Agnar the Fierce and Gotron the Agile. Both of whom were also interested for the duty of guarding the Bifrost. Heimdall is the brother of Sif and frequent ally and friend to Thor. He is a highly respected and standing Asgardian, occasionally even serving as temporary ruler of Asgard. |||| |||| Not only has Heimdall served as sentry of the Bifrost bridge, but he has also been active as an agent for Odin. Heimdall played a large role in locating and gathering several mortals who would go on to be a part of the Young Gods, new super beings that would be used to pacify the Celestials judgement of Earth. Heimdall would specifically gather Chi Lo, Carter Dylam and Jason Kimball otherwise known as Harvest, Bright Sword and Genii respectively. After the powerful entity Surtur defeated Heimdall and destroyed the Bifrost, Heimdall would even briefly romance Enchantress, but would eventually return to his stand as the guardian of Bifrost upon its reconstruction. Heimdall would also take part in a rescue mission to save his sister Sif, as well as stand in for Odin as ruler of Asgard when the All Father required rest. |||| |||| *** |||| |||| Heimdall was the brother of the warrior Sif. For ages, he stood as the guardian of Asgard's rainbow bridge, defending the city's gates from any intruders, and was one of the most trusted servants of Odin. When Asgard was invaded by the fire demon Surtur, Heimdall attempted to defend the gates, but was overcome, and the Rainbow Bridge was destroyed. No longer needing to be stationary, Heimdall spent more time in Asgard, and became close to Amora the Enchantress, who was soon infatuated with him. When Odin returned to Asgard after Surtur's defeat, he gave a portion of his power to Heimdall to rebuild the Rainbow Bridge, and Heimdall resumed his duties. |||| |||| Shortly afterwards, when Odin was about to enter his Odinsleep, he passed the Odinpower on to Heimdall to rule Asgard until he awoke. Heimdall had to deal with a major crisis in the life of Thor, as Thor had been banished into the subconsciousness of the mortal Eric Masterson, who had assumed Thor's responsibilities. Sif was determined to find the real Thor, and her determination drove a wedge between her and Heimdall. When Karnilla conspired with Loki to rule Asgard by having Odin awaken with Loki's soul possessing him, Heimdall was branded a traitor and banished to the Dream Dimension, where he was saved from the demon Nightmare by Amora. Eric Masterson helped restore Odin and later Thor as well, but Heimdall and Amora drifted apart when Amora realized that his duty to Asgard was greater than his love for her. |||| When Odin cast the Asgardians into the guises of mortals to protect them from a false Ragnarok, Heimdall became Donald Velez, and joined the other 'Lost Gods' in attempting to rediscover who they were and battling the Egyptian death-god Seth. Heimdall and the others regained their true forms and defeated Seth just as Asgard was attacked by the Dark Gods, and they were all taken prisoner. They were finally rescued by Thor. Recently, Asgard was struck by another Ragnarok, one from which there was no seeming reversal. Heimdall perished in battle defending his people. |||| |||| It has been revealed that Thor has broken the cycle of Ragnarok, the end of all things that has seemingly come to Asgard many times. Heimdall, along with the others of Asgard, have been reborn on Earth yet again. A new version of the city has been established in Oklahoma. |||| |||| Thor traveled to New Orleans to start his journey of finding the missing gods. After a confrontation with Iron Man, he encounters a man named Ezra, keeping vigil over a bridge. Realizing who he really is, Thor releases Heimdall from within the mortal. Heimdall was drawn to Ezra due to them both feeling angry and helpless due to the fact that neither of them could stop the destruction of their cities, New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and Asgard during Ragnarok. Heimdall has now joined Thor in the new Asgard."

67,Iceman (Marvel),Robert Louis 'Bobby' Drake ,67_20060308113659_char.jpg,"Iceman is able to lower his external and internal body temperature without harm to himself, thereby radiating intense cold from his body. Iceman is able to reach -105 degrees Fahrenheit within a few seconds, and is immune to sub-zero temperatures around him. |||| In addition, Iceman can freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice, and thereby form simple objects such as slides, ladders, shields, and bats. Iceman can also augment his ice form with extraneous moisture to enhance his strength and durability, and can reshape his body's ice form at will by using any available moisture from his surrounding environment. Similarly, Iceman can rebuild his ice form if any part of it is broken or if it is shattered completely without suffering any permanent damage. |||| |||| Previously, Iceman was able to transform his body into solid ice and back to human form at will. Recently, however, his body has since permanently transformed into solid ice as a result of a secondary mutation. |||| |||| Iceman also possesses the potential to transport himself quickly over great distances through nearby flows of water by merging his body’s molecules with those of the stream.",,"Bobby Drake discovered his mutant power to create ice while in his early teens, yet kept his condition hidden from everyone but his parents. Initially, Bobby was unable to stop feeling cold and shivering, but soon managed to keep it under control. When a bully named Rocky Beasely and his friends attacked Bobby and his then-girlfriend, Judy Harmon, the youngster panicked. To save Harmon, Bobby temporarily encased Rocky in ice, thus revealing his abilities for all to see. Believing the boy to be a menace, the townspeople organized a lynch mob. They broke into Bobby's home and overpowered him, but the local sheriff took the teenager into custody for his own protection. Meanwhile, the situation had come to the attention of Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic mentor of the team of teenage mutant super heroes the X-Men. |||| |||| Professor X dispatched his first X-Man, Cyclops, to contact Bobby. Cyclops stole into the jailhouse as planned, but the two began fighting when Bobby refused to accompany him. Caught by the lynch mob, Cyclops and Bobby were about to be hanged when they broke free. Professor X used his mental powers to halt the townspeople in their tracks and erase their memories of Bobby's powers. A grateful Bobby then accepted Xavier's invitation to enroll at his School for Gifted Youngsters and took the codename Iceman. Though initially manifesting as a snow-like form, Bobby soon learned to increase his degree of cold control resulting in an ice-like, almost transparent form. |||| |||| Hated and feared by humanity, the X-Men honed their amazing abilities while standing in defense of a world pushed to the brink of genetic war by a handful of mutant terrorists. Iceman, the team's youngest founding member, became known as the comedian of the group. Regardless, he pulled his weight and worked well with rest of the team. |||| |||| Following a short break-up after believing their mentor was dead, the X-Men reformed with two new members - the magnetism-manipulating Polaris and the plasma-charged Havok. Bobby had a brief romantic relationship with Polaris until she realized that her heart belonged to Havok. Bobby had trouble accepting her decision, which led to increased tension between himself and Havok. Eventually, Bobby quit the team for a short time to sort out his feelings. |||| |||| Later, when the sentient island-being known as Krakoa took Bobby and his team mates captive, Professor X assembled a second team of X-Men to rescue them. Soon after, most of the founding members left the team and Bobby began attending college on a scholarship. Eventually, he helped his former team mate Angel form the Champions of Los Angeles. When the Champions disbanded, Bobby went missing, and Angel teamed up with the costumed adventurer Spider-Man to find him. Bobby had been hypnotized by the Champions' enemy Rampage into donning his battle suit, and Angel and Spider-Man were forced to battle him. After Rampage was defeated, Bobby quit his life as a costumed adventurer and returned to college full time to study accounting. |||| |||| Later, Bobby was contacted by Professor X to assist in rescuing friends and family of the X-Men from the assassin known as Arcade. Along with other former X-Men Banshee, Polaris, and Havok, the ad-hoc team managed to free the hostages and Bobby finally came to accept Polaris' love for Havok. |||| |||| During a summer break from college Bobby went to visit his former X-Men teammate Beast and soon became involved with the loose-knit collection of costumed heroes known as the Defenders. Along with Beast and Angel, Bobby helped reorganize the team into a more formal and cohesive unit. The Defenders eventually disbanded when several of their members appeared to perish during a climactic battle. |||| |||| Soon after, Bobby joined the other founding X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting down those perceived menaces to society. During his time with the team, the Asgardian trickster god Loki captured Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhanced Bobby's powers to such an extent that he was forced to wear a power-dampening belt that was originally created by the subversive organization known as The Right to cancel out his powers. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby found he could encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gained sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he had achieved his full potential, Bobby never attempted to push himself beyond his perceived limits. |||| |||| When Professor Xavier returned to Earth following an extended absence in outer space, Bobby and the other members of X-Factor rejoined the X-Men. Shortly thereafter, Bobby confronted former Cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin, the reality-warping mutant brother of Bobby’s steel-skinned teammate Colossus. Rasputin forced Bobby into a form composed entirely of ice, affording the young mutant a glimpse into his true nature. Subsequently, Bobby began experimenting with his abilities - using ice to add mass to his slight frame, or lift himself high into the air without the benefit of his usual slides. |||| |||| Months later, the psychically incapacitated mutant telepath Emma Frost took mental possession of Bobby's body. Frost was able to activate the full extent of his powers, using his powers in ways Bobby had not thought possible until she was coaxed back into her own body by Professor X. With Frost's prodding, Iceman later learned to completely transform his body into its full ice state on his own. Frost later also showed Bobby that he could safely revert back to his human form after his ice form's chest had been shattered in battle. |||| |||| Bobby later took a leave of absence from the X-Men to spend more time with his father who had been injured by the grass roots anti-mutant movement the Friends of Humanity. He returned briefly to the X-Men to rescue mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes during the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance, after which he returned to his father's side. |||| |||| Two subsequent events served to shed further light on Iceman's untapped potential. To secure a new host body, the would-be conqueror Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of 'The Twelve' - mutants of incredible power, destined to alter the course of human history. Among their number was Iceman, who survived the ordeal thanks only to the apparent sacrifice of Cyclops. |||| |||| A second defining event occurred when the sentient spaceship Prosh escaped the confines of a Celestial prison, returned to Earth and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Their mission: Save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the Stranger, who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants. |||| |||| These experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer need fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returned to the X-Men to explore his mutant powers to the fullest. After suffering a chest injury, Bobby was unable to prevent his body from transforming into solid ice due to the manifestation of a secondary mutation. |||| |||| After the House of M incident Iceman was believed to be among the mutants who lost their powers, but this apparent loss of powers was quickly revealed to be a subconscious reaction to the trauma of that reality warp. Since recovering his powers, his ice form has taken on a much more jagged appearance. |||| Recently, Iceman has been using his powers in innovative ways, including the ability to exist as a sentient gas. He discovered this ability while fighting the Children of the Vault when they attacked the Mansion. After the fight with the Children, he joined Rogue's team of X-Men. |||| |||| [At an unspecified time, all five original adolescent X-Men had been plucked from their timeline and transferred to the future to interact with their adult selves.  During this event young Jean revealed to young Bobby that her telepathic abilities had discovered that he is gay (All New X-Men #40).]"

However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. |||| |||| When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development on the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America had vetoed the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, 'I want you to die.' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. |||| |||| Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who take part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two incapacitated. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be sidelined to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. |||| |||| Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells. ||||"
138,Mr. Fantastic (Marvel)(01 - Reed Richards),Dr. Reed Richards ,138_20061008093249_char.jpg,,"Like many elastic substances, his body is susceptible to extremes of temperature, becoming brittle in very cold environments, for instance.","A child prodigy who would grow to become one of the world's most intelligent human beings, Reed Richards pursued his scientific genius from an early age, enrolling in college at age 14, and obtaining a number of advanced degrees from a variety of institutions.  During this time, he met lifelong friend Ben Grimm, future wife Sue Storm, and Victor von Doom, a fellow student and intellectual rival whose jealousy would lead him over time to become Reed's nemesis, Doctor Doom. |||| |||| When the government cut funding for Reed's research in manned space travel, he set out to pursue the project on his own.  Convinced they would be safe, he allowed Sue and her younger brother Johnny to accompany him and Ben on a test flight, during which they were exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation and forced to crash-land.  As it turned out, the radiation transformed each of the passengers, leading to their careers as the superhuman Fantastic Four, with Reed as their leader. |||| |||| The Fantastic Four has had many adventures over the years, propelled by Reed's scientific inventions, and motivated by their concern for the betterment of the world.  Funded by money from patents Reed has developed, the group operates out of the Baxter Building in Manhattan, although their journeys take them across the span of any number of universes, times, and dimensions. |||| |||| Having married, Reed and Sue have two children, Franklin and Valeria, the first of which, at least, has exhibited his own superpowers, capable of bending reality on a fundamental level.  In recent years, Reed has been involved with some of the most important events in the Marvel universe, helping to exile the Hulk in space, and working alongside Tony Stark to enforce the Super-human Registration Act.  While these actions have had some conflicts between Reed and even his closest friends and family, including a period of alienation from Sue, he has proven to be motivated always by a concern for the greater good, acting in accord with what rationality dictates is the best course, no matter how seemingly unpopular. ||||"

7515,Orka (Marvel),,7515_20070402124011_char.jpg,"Orka's original physiology was that of a Atlantean who happened to be a twenty four foot giant. As typical Atlanteans can lift roughly 10 to 30 tons depending on their athletic prowess, a giant of hulkish muscular proportions such as Orka could lift several times that amount; roughly 90 tons. Later his physiology was augmented so that it was at least equal to that of Namor the Submariner who can lift 100 tons or more when in contact with water. |||| |||| He once utilized a costume which augmented his strength greatly by psionically harnessing power from killer whales through artificial means. It also allowed him to exist on land although when not in contact with water he was roughly thirty three percent weaker. At present he no longer needs his costume to utilize such powers due to scientific experimentation conducted upon his physiology. His improved phsyiology had the side effect of reducing his intelligence, though not the degree of a mental handicap. |||| |||| Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales (whose company he prefers to Atlanteans). When he is in their presence he is considerably stronger than normal. He can also swim at superhuman speeds. He can survive on land much longer than typical Atlanteans, though it is has not been revealed if prolonged exposure of several days or more will kill him. Orka's endurance is heightened to the degree that conventional weaponry has no effect on him. |||| |||| Orka has the typical training of an Atlantean warrior and is a highly skilled fighter. This is often not very obvious as his intellect is a weakness often exploited by lesser adversaries.",,"Orka was once an Atlantean and grew to become one of the strongest (but relatively dim-witted) soldiers in Warlord Krang's army. Orka stayed with Krang when he attempted to gain the throne from Namor the Sub-Mariner, and was exiled with his leader. Soon, Orka was chosen to be the test subject of Dr. Dorcas, who wanted to imbue a soldier with the power of a killer whale (At this point, Orka needed to wear a belt which transferred the power of Dorcas' captive killer whales). Namor defeated the rebels, and Orka was buried in an undersea avalanche. |||| |||| Later, Orka managed to get free but was defeated by Namor again. The Brand Corporation (subsidiary of Roxxon Oil) contacted Orka and augmented his abilities to not require a power-transferring machine. He was then sent on a mission that brought him in conflict with the Avengers, but was defeated by Thor. |||| |||| Somehow, he managed to escape from prison (he was seen in the Vault during the break-out called 'Acts of Vengeance') and found his way to the Atlantic, where he was among Attuma's henchmen in his Deep Six group (alongside Nagala, Pirahna, Sea Urchin, and Tiger Shark) when Attuma attacked the United States where they were defeated by Namor and clashed with the Defenders on different occasions. |||| |||| Later, Orka was among those villains recruited by the self-proclaimed Master of the World in his attempt to overthrow the United Nations, only to be captured by the new Heroes for Hire team. He also fought Namorita once, but was later defeated by a blast coming from Nova. |||| |||| Orka recently tried to engage Nightwing Restorations, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight's bail bond company for supervillains, to bail out Stilt-Man. Recently Orka joined the Heroes For Hire, along with a few other reformed supervillains. Currently he works with the team to hunt supervillains."

Later, when Deathbird was Empress, she commanded the entire Imperial Guard to fight the combined forces of the Starjammers and Excalibur so that she could claim the power of the Phoenix Force for herself. During the battle, Astra surprised Shadowcat with the ability to hit her in intangible state, since she could match her molecular density. |||| |||| During the crisis that came to be known as Operation: Galactic Storm, Astra was amongst a small contingent of the Imperial Guard that defended Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as Starforce. Astra was also with the Imperial Guard when they defended their Empress Lilandra against an assassination attempt from the Inhumans, who were under the control of Ronan the Accuser at the time. ||||"
3182,Count Nefaria (Marvel),Luchino Nefaria ,3182_20070125122114_char.jpg,"When his body is fully charged with ionic energy, Nefaria possesses tremendous, nearly immeasurable strength and durability, high-level superhuman speed, the power of flight, and the ability to fire powerful laser beams from his eyes. In recent times, he has also proven capable of forming and manipulating crude ionic energy constructs, such as an energy strand used to lasso an opponent. If Nefaria's bodily ionic energy reserves dwindle too low, his powers start to fade and his body begins to wither and age rapidly. Nefaria periodically replenishes his energies by draining power from outside sources of ionic energy, often draining other ionic-powered super-beings like himself. If Nefaria drains too much energy too quickly, his victim will die. Like other ionic super-beings such as Atlas and Wonder Man, Nefaria has apparently developed astounding regenerative powers, enabling him to heal himself from a seemingly deceased state or even reintegrate his bodily matter after exploding.",,"Born a wealthy Italian nobleman, Count Luchino Nefaria grew up regarding himself as one of the rightful masters of the world, and has dedicated his life to making this grandiose self-image a reality. While Nefaria has long devoted himself to the funding and development of exotic new sciences and technologies, he also treasures old-world values, often presenting himself in the manner of a courtly feudal nobleman of ages past. Apparently not content with the power afforded him by wealth and nobility, Nefaria risked his prized respectability and entered the world of organized crime, secretly becoming a leading figure in the international criminal cartel known as the Maggia. With his vast wealth, high-tech resources and natural gift for criminal strategy, Nefaria soon became the leader of his own thriving crime family within the Maggia organization, all the while concealing his criminal connections from the general public. |||| |||| Luchino wanted a male heir to perpetuate the Nefaria line, but his wife Renata died giving birth to their only child, their daughter Giulietta. Wishing to protect the child from his enemies and hoping to shield her from ever learning of his criminal empire, Nefaria placed her in the custody of Byron Frost, an American financier heavily indebted to Nefaria, and he had Frost raise her as his own adopted daughter, Whitney. While Whitney grew up in America, blissfully unaware of her true parentage, Count Nefaria's Maggia family began expanding their operations into the United States, but they were repeatedly opposed by America's crimefighters, particularly the Avengers. Deciding to handle this obstacle personally, Nefaria had his ancestral castle moved from Italy to New Jersey stone by stone. Opening the castle to public tours and donating the admission money to charity, the seemingly benevolent Nefaria invited the unwitting Avengers to his home, where he trapped them in stasis long enough to frame them for treason by using sophisticated illusions. Reduced to hunted fugitives, the Avengers stormed Nefaria's castle and defeated his mob soldiers, though Wasp was gravely wounded in the process. In the end, the heroes rescued their young Teen Brigade allies from one of Nefaria's death traps, the Avengers were exonerated, and Nefaria was exposed to the world as a criminal. |||| |||| The Avengers' defeat of Nefaria hurt the influence and stature of Nefaria's Maggia crime family considerably. While he worked to rebuild his empire, Nefaria contacted the now-adult Whitney Frost, revealed he was her father, and invited her to join his Maggia crime family so that he could train her as his future successor. Horrified, Whitney refused the offer at first, but Nefaria threatened to expose her parentage to the world, and her own fiancé abandoned her after he learned the truth about her family. Losing all hope of a normal life, a broken Whitney joined her father's organization, soon becoming his second-in-command. Nefaria, still plotting to destroy the Avengers, targeted Iron Man (secretly Avengers financier Tony Stark) with an illusion-casting 'nightmare machine' in an attempt to frighten him literally to death, but Iron Man resisted the device, which a frustrated Nefaria accidentally wrecked. Nefaria next conspired with Tony Stark's ne'er-do-well cousin, Morgan Stark, to ruin Tony's reputation, but this scheme failed as well. Nefaria later shocked the nation by sealing the entire city of Washington under an artificial dome and holding it for ransom, but he and his super-criminal accomplices were defeated by the original X-Men and the city was freed. Nefaria was imprisoned and his daughter took over their Maggia crime family, but the Count soon escaped. |||| |||| Frozen out of the Maggia due to his very public failures, Nefaria became an independent criminal operator. Employing the Ani-Men (whom he had his scientists mutate into superhumans), Nefaria seized the North American Air Defense Command at Valhalla Mountain in Colorado and threatened to launch America's nuclear arsenal unless he was paid an enormous ransom. His scheme was thwarted by a new team of X-Men, including Thunderbird (James Proudstar), who died trying to prevent Nefaria's escape. His monetary and technological resources dwindling, Nefaria sought superhuman power for himself. Assembling Living Laser, Power Man (Erik Josten) and Whirlwind to battle the Avengers as a new Lethal Legion, Nefaria had their powers boosted by scientist Kenneth Sturdy, but it was a deliberately temporary boost. While the Legion was captured, Sturdy used his process (derived from the ionic energy treatments of Baron Zemo) to give Nefaria the Legion's combined powers, magnified a hundredfold. Despite Nefaria's newly god-like power, the Avengers managed to defeat him after a desperate battle, and the villain learned that he was aging rapidly as a result of the process that gave him his powers. |||| |||| Deteriorating into an aged invalid who needed a special life-support system, Nefaria escaped custody with the aid of the Ani-Men and his daughter, who by this time had become romantically involved with Tony Stark. When Iron Man (whom Whitney knew to be Stark) tried to take Nefaria back into custody, the Ani-Men and Whitney resisted, and Nefaria was accidentally crushed during the battle. Betrayed by her lover and convinced her father was dead, an increasingly bitter and paranoid Whitney went deep into hiding in her role as crime boss Madame Masque, operating mostly through surrogates for years, even producing clones of herself to act in her stead (one of these 'bio-duplicates,' a rogue known simply as Masque, broke away from Whitney's service and briefly served as an honorary Avenger before she was recaptured). |||| |||| Nefaria eventually revived, apparently sharing the regenerative properties common among ionic super-beings; however, he found that he needed to drain ionic energy from others in order to maintain his vitality. Becoming a sort of ionic vampire, Nefaria stalked and drained various ionic-powered beings, killing some of them (notably the Nefaria imitator known as Nefarius) and capturing others (the Deathweb's ionic Therak was imprisoned as an energy source for some time). Trying to cover his tracks, Nefaria was eventually found out and exposed by his old foe Iron Man. Later, Nefaria imprisoned and cloned the inhabitants of the Savage Land for experimental purposes, trying to create a race of ionic beings he could feed off so that he wouldn't have to keep hunting down existing ionics. He was defeated and captured by Captain America and Sharon Carter and left in the custody of the Savage Landers, though he soon escaped. Attacking ionic-powered heroes Atlas and Wonder Man, Nefaria absorbed some of their energy and realized that this process enabled him to subjugate their wills, too. |||| |||| Aided by his new slaves, Nefaria sought to consolidate the Maggia crime families under his leadership (with the Grim Reaper acting as his lieutenant) and tried to force Whitney to return to his service, all as part of a larger scheme to mutate the entire world with ionic radiation so that everyone would be compelled to obey Nefaria. His plot was thwarted through the combined efforts of Whitney, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts, though not before Nefaria murdered the heroic bio-duplicate Masque, whom he believed to be his rebellious daughter. In the end, Nefaria was apparently blown to atoms, but he somehow survived and was jailed in the super-prison known as The Raft, where he was recently among the many inmates who escaped during a prison break sparked by Electro."

He was due to be executed by King Philip of Spain, when the King learned Valor had just married the king's own ward, Donna Bonita.  The King then struck a bargain with Valor, promising to spare his life if he would serve the Spanish flag.  Valor agreed under the condition that the flag would always represent the cause of justice.  Eventually, though, Spain disappointed, and Valor fled back to England.   He and Donna had a son, Justin, who took to the seas with him.  Justin, though, eventually was injured, forcing Valor to rethink his life.   He thus unmasked himself before King Charles and swore to disavow the pirate's life forever.  His son, though, had made no such vow, and became embroiled in the cause of the Puritans.  Needing cash for their impending journey to America, Justin pirated Charles' vessels for the Puritans.  Charles called Valor out of retirement to discover who was behind this new wave of pirating.  When Jon investigated he was shocked to discover it was his own son.  They made a peace, however, that allowed Justin to set sail for America with the Puritans, and satisfy Charles' requirement that Jon end the wave of pirating.

251,Black Mask (DC)(01 - Roman Sionis),Roman Sionis ,251_20070330213102_char.jpg,,,"Roman Sionis was born into one of Gotham City�s elite families, to parents who were wealthy and utterly self-absorbed, caring more about their social status than their son; moments after his birth, the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head. Roman's parents were less concerned about their son's well-being and more concerned about covering up the entire incident out of fear of how their wealthy friends would react to the news of their son's injury. A second incident occurred when he was a child. While at the Sinois family country estate he was attacked by a rabid raccoon. This incident was also covered up by the Sionis family, with Roman being forbidden from mentioning it to anyone. |||| |||| Further adding to the cauldron was his father's 'friendship' with Thomas Wayne; both of Roman's parents disliked the Waynes and were quite vocal about it in private with their son. However, to their son's dismay, they continued to associate with Thomas and Martha Wayne and pretended to be friends with the couple, to the extent of literally forcing him to become friends with their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on him, and he grew to hate and resent them and the 'masks' they wore in public. |||| |||| When he graduated high school, Sionis was given a high ranking position inside his fathers company, Janus Cosmetics. It was there that he met and fell in love with Circe, a young working class secretary. His parents didn't approve of the relationship and made it clear that they wanted the romance ended. Enraged, Roman burned down the family's mansion, killing both of his parents. Upon their deaths he inherited the family fortune and business. As Roman wasn't the businessman his father was he ended up ruining Janus Cosmetics by funding a line of face-paint make-up which failed. In desperation he threw large sums of money at the staff chemists to create a product to save the company, and what came back to him was a kind of water-proof make up. The product was rushed to market without proper testing, and once it hit the market turned out to be a deadly toxin which disfigured several hundred women. |||| |||| Circe, now Sionis' fiancé, broke up with him in front of his entire staff. At that time, now successful mogul Bruce Wayne offered to bail out the company on the condition that Sionis give up control and allow Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Sionis agreed, but was furious at the perceived humiliation and dramatic loss of face he had suffered. He went to the family mausoleum and broke his mother's ebony coffin lid and carved a mask from a large chunk of it, becoming Black Mask as he had always been obsessed with masks, and the idea that a person becomes someone else when they wear one. |||| |||| Sionis found he had an amazing aptitude for crime, and he soon had a large gang working for him. Calling them the False Face Society, the one requirement was that all members must select a mask from his collection and wear it at all times when on the job and in his presence. They were successfully gaining power in the Gotham underworld, until Black Mask decided it was time to take his revenge on Bruce Wayne. He began kidnapping Wayne Enterprise executives, putting masks on their faces that were coated in the deadly make-up once made by Janus Cosmetics. He also targeted Circe and forcibly disfigured her with the chemicals in order to force her to reunite with him. Circe would ultimately kill herself, leading Black Mask to replace her with a mannequin that he talked to as if it were a real person. |||| |||| These kidnappings drew Batman's attention, and he began hunting down the False Facers. He slowly began to dismantle the organization until he finally found Black Mask in the ruins of the Sionis Family home. Black Mask lit the wreckage on fire trying to escape, but was caught in the burning house. Batman was able to save him, but the mask had been burned onto his face and left him disfigured. |||| |||| Black Mask spent some time in Arkham Asylum, but escaped when Bane assaulted the facility in Knightfall and subsequently restarted the False Facers. He took on a new second-in-command, called Tattoo (whose face was covered in a tattoo mask pattern), and he began burning down Wayne properties. This time he also kidnapped Lucius Fox, CEO of Waynetech and friend of Bruce Wayne. Batman infiltrated the gang and was able to save Fox from Black Mask's torture, and even brought in Tattoo, but Black Mask escaped. |||| |||| Some time later, Black Mask reappeared as a mob-boss/cult figure who had given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. Making allegiance with the Penguin at some times, working alone at others, he controlled much of Gotham's underworld until the city was destroyed by an earthquake and declared by the government to be a 'No Man's Land.' |||| |||| Sionis discarded the ebony mask, believing his scars to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely insane, he led a cult whose trademark was ritual scarring, killing anyone who refused to join. He led a powerful group until Batman and Huntress dissolved it. Sionis was imprisoned in Blackgate Penitentiary, but he managed to escape before the city was made a part of the country again. |||| |||| Black Mask had lost much of his power base, and it took him some time to rebuild his empire. He began a drug trafficking ring and decided to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of Catwoman, who had sworn to protect that area of the city. |||| |||| Catwoman interfered in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decided he wanted to remove the problem, and so found an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who was working in the Gotham mobs. She revealed Catwoman's secret identity to him, and he began a campaign of terror against her. He blew up the new youth center she had endowed with the stolen money, hounded her, and kidnapped her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortured Catwoman's brother-in-law brutally in front of her sister, and then made the woman eat pieces of her husband's corpse. |||| |||| Catwoman arrived to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend Holly on the verge of being tortured. She attacked Black Mask, and the two of them fought across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask fell from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he was dead. |||| |||| When Tim Drake quit his role as Robin in order to honor a promise to his father, Batman chose Stephanie Brown, aka Spoiler, to replace him. Batman quickly discovered that her lack of focus and self-absorption made her a danger to herself and others, and fired her. Desperate to prove herself, she took one of Batman's contingency plans and set it into action with the intent of shepherding it to a successful conclusion. The plan was to get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of Orpheus, an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan failed because Spoiler was unaware that a key contact with the crime lords, Matches Malone, was actually another alter ego of Batman himself. When 'Matches Malone' did not appear as expected, the tension at the meeting accidentally degenerated into a firefight, leaving many dead and wounded. This created a power vacuum that quickly erupted into a brutal gang war on the streets of Gotham. |||| |||| Desperate to rectify the situation, Spoiler sought Orpheus, believing that if she could enlist his help there might still be a chance to bring the plan to some sort of successful conclusion. As she finished telling Orpheus his role in the plan, Black Mask murdered him by slitting his throat in front of Spoiler. He then tortured Spoiler for the rest of information on the plan. |||| |||| Black Mask assumed Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, (as seen in 'Batman: War Games, Act 2') managing to fool even Batman and Onyx. As Orpheus he fanned the flames of the crisis, driving Gotham's criminal element into a bloodthirsty, destructive mob seeking to kill any member or associate of the Batman Family. He then returned to torture Spoiler for his own enjoyment only to find that she had escaped. Black Mask soon tracked her down again and they fought. Spoiler managed to overcome Black Mask and get away, but was left with severe internal injuries. |||| |||| Black Mask then infiltrated Oracle's Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the criminal mob. Batman attacked him in a blind rage and Oracle, fearful for Batman's life, was forced to activate a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her. |||| |||| In the end, the Spoiler died due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of Leslie Thompkins. (Although a recent retcon states that Black Mask 'tortured and killed' Stephanie Brown in current continuity.) |||| |||| Black Mask then rose to become the overlord of the Gotham underworld. |||| |||| Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask began a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slammed Batman in the press, Black Mask committed a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan was complicated by the arrival of the Joker. Black Mask was intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wanted to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another Robin. The two nearly killed each other before Batman intervened. Batman eventually exposed Rodriguez and finally managed to capture Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, he managed to kill the escorting officer and escape again. |||| |||| The assassin Deathstroke later approached Black Mask offering him a place within The Society. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld (Batman and the new Red Hood had both been targeting his operations), he accepted, and Captain Nazi, one of the Hyenas, and Count Vertigo were sent after Batman and Red Hood. However, these villains were defeated, and Batman ultimately prevented the Society from securing a foothold in Gotham. |||| |||| In an attempt to 'improve himself' after this debacle, Black Mask threatened the most important people in Catwoman's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly Robinson. Still thinking that she adhered to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask was caught by surprise when Catwoman retaliated by shooting him in the head and blowing off his jaw, killing him. |||| |||| After the shooting, Selina Kyle passed the mantle of Catwoman to her friend Holly. Not long after, Holly was arrested for the killing of Black Mask."

Around the age of 13, Angel, unaware of her slowly manifesting mutant powers, began to give off microwave pulses when she was under stress. These microwave emissions were detected by both Professor Charles Xavier of The X-Men and Emma Frost (The White Queen) of The Hellfire Club, both of whom wanted to recruit Firestar to their respective schools, but both for very different reasons. |||| |||| During a particularly stressful moment, Angel called her grandmother, but melted the pay phone from which she was making the call. Returning home that evening, she was devastated to find that Nana had passed away that afternoon from natural causes. Feeling she had nowhere else to turn, she revealed her secret to her father, who, overwhelmed, didn’t handle the situation in the best manner. Now feeling completely alone, Angel was easy prey for Frost, who was able to get to Angel before Professor X and his X-Men were. Frost, using her telepathic abilities told Angel everything she wanted to hear, and with her father’s permission, Angel was enrolled in Frost’s Massachusetts Academy. |||| |||| Over the next few years, Angel, with the help of Frost, developed her powers and was given the codename Firestar. Frost, kind on the outside, was secretly training Angel to become an assassin for The Hellfire Club. Angel was kept at a distance from Frost’s other students, The Hellions, at Frost’s request, and Angel’s only real friend during her time at the Academy was her bodyguard, Randall Chase. Angel joined the Hellions Empath, Roulette and Thunderbird for a short period when she was manipulated by them into attacking The X-Men, where she battled Colossus. During their battle, Colossus noted that he could have killed the inexperienced Firestar with a single blow, but was unable to bring himself to do so. After the battle, Angel turned down an offer from Professor X to join his X-Men, still believing Frost to be like a mother to her. |||| |||| At the age of 16, Frost decided it was time to put her plans into motion, and began to manipulate Angel, trying to get her to kill her Hellfire Club rival Selene, The Black Queen. Knowing Frost would be sending Angel on a suicide mission, Chase decided he had to help her, and after being brutally beaten by Frost’s minions, Chase told Angel the full truth as he died in her arms. Furious, Angel destroyed Frost’s training facilities, and threatened Frost’s life if she were to ever come near or her family again. |||| |||| Angel decided to retire her Firestar persona, but that decision was soon detoured by Night Thrasher, who wanted Firestar to join the new group he was putting together. Summoning Firestar by using blackmail, he brought together himself, Firestar, Nova and Marvel Boy (Vance Astrovik later known as Justice) to form his team. They were soon put to the test against a returning Terrax, and were joined in battle by Namorita and Speedball. Defeating Terrax, the six teens decided to stay together and form the group, dubbed by the media, The New Warriors. During her time with the New Warriors, Firestar came into much greater control of her powers, and became an incredibly powerful force. Night Thrasher even commented at one point that Firestar could blow apart the planet if she so wished. As a group, The New Warriors faced down many foes, including the Juggernaut, Star-Thief, Psionex, The Sphinx, Force of Nature, The White Queen and her Hellions (who came to lay claim to Firestar) and Gamesmaster. It was also during this time, that Angel and Vance struck up a lasting and loving relationship, even getting engaged. |||| |||| Her father, having grown to accept Angel’s powers and become a loving father to her, was at one point, shot point blank in the chest by a street-gang group known as The Poison Memories, who had a vendetta against Night Thrasher and struck out at the New Warriors. Upon finding her father with her best friend Jupiter, Angel had no choice but to reveal her powers to Jupiter to save her father. Her father recovered, and Angel and Jupiter’s friendship grew even stronger. |||| |||| It was soon after that Angel learned that continued use of her powers could have devastating side-effects on her body, including making her sterile. Wanting to have a family one day, Angel started to seriously reconsider her priorities. During a break from The New Warriors, Firestar and Justice joined Rage in helping during an Avengers mission, and after was recruited into the Avengers alongside Justice. During her stint there, Hank Pym was able to develop a suit Angel could wear under her uniform that would cure her of the side-effects her powers were having on her and naturally speed up the immunity to her powers she should have developed on her own. Overjoyed, Angel recommitted to her life as a super-hero and became a core member of The Avengers. |||| |||| Deciding to take a break and focus on their relationship, Angel and Vance took some time to focus on their relationship. This was interrupted when Iron Man requested that the two infiltrate the Triune Understanding, a group that had been causing The Avengers much problems over the past few months. They did so, and the true nature of the Triune was soon discovered. The pair also helped The Avengers battle Kang during his take over of the world. They returned to reserve status right afterwards. |||| |||| At the age of 19, Angel started to feel overwhelmed with a life that consisted of being engaged, being a super-hero, and being a college student. Vance was able to sense a distance from Angel, and upon confronting her about it, she admitted that she felt like she was too young to get married. The two called off the long-standing engagement and went their separate ways. |||| |||| Most recently, the Superhuman Registration Act forced all openly active super-hero’s to register their identities with the federal government. During an interview with Sally Floyd for the newspaper Front Line, Angel recounted how the last time her identity was known, her father was almost killed. Deciding the risks were not worth it, Angel retired from being an active super-hero. With the recent events of the Skrull’s Secret Invasion, and the SHRA and the Initiative program taking the brunt of the fall-out for having failed to protect the world the way it was supposed to, it remains to be seen if Angel’s retirement will continue or if she’ll come back to the life of a super-hero."
350,Hourman (02 - Rick Tyler),Rick Tyler ,350_20070218083332_char.jpg,,,"Rick Tyler, Rex's son, took over the Hourman mantle during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Rick swallowed some of his father's Miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital. After serving for a few years as a member of Infinity, Inc., a team largely comprised of other JSA-member children, Rick began to grow addicted to Miraclo just as his father did. He spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until the android Hourman cured him of his Miraclo addiction. Having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health, Rick joined the re-formed JSA. He discovered that he had two added abilities: being able to see one hour into the future and to visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the Timepoint, frozen in time, just before Rex's death. Recently, Rick was severely injured in battle, and switched places with his father to save his life. Tyler, the android known as the third Hourman, took Rex and some other JSA members to the Timepoint to save Rick's life. The one hour Rex was allotted in the Timepoint expired just as Doctor Mid-Nite and Tyler had healed Rick of his injuries. Father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with Extant. Ultimately, Tyler the android took Rex's place and was destroyed as Rick and Rex returned to earth. Rick is once again active as Hourman."

His speed is superhuman (enabling him to outrun an express train with ease), and his stamina, reflexes and recuperative powers are also enhanced beyond normal human levels.",,"Twelve-year-old Elvin Haliday was visiting an unfamiliar neighborhood to trade some comic books with another boy when he was attacked by a gang of racist bullies. Elvin eluded them by hiding in the heavily polluted waters of Newtown Creek, but before he could climb out, Fisk Biochem workers dumped more illegal chemical waste into the creek, dousing him with it. Terrified and in pain, Elvin ran home to his only family, Granny Staples, and she nursed him back to health over a period of days. The boy recovered quickly, and in the weeks and months that followed, he went through a tremendous growth spurt that gave him a superhumanly powerful adult body. He was discouraged from seeking vengeance on his tormentors by the devoutly religious Granny Staples, who felt he should use his new powers for good. Fashioning a makeshift costume from a ski mask and a leather outfit, Elvin began operating as the super-vigilante Rage at the age of 14, targeting street criminals and drug dealers such as L.D. 50. He applied for membership in the Avengers, berating the team for their elitism and lack of visible minorities. Despite this obnoxious introduction, he was appointed a probationary Avengers reservist alongside Sandman after aiding the group in an otherdimensional mission. Though technically part of a substitute roster serving as backup for the active team, Rage was a frequent participant in Avengers cases, facing foes such as Ngh the Unspeakable, the Tetrarchs of Entropy, Doctor Doom, the Brethren, the Collector and Grotesk. |||| |||| |||| Eventually, during a conflict with Hate-Monger and his racist pawns, the Sons of the Serpent, the Avengers discovered that Elvin was still a child and demoted him to trainee status. During that case, Elvin met the New Warriors, who befriended him and later convinced him to help them steal an Avengers quinjet for an emergency rescue mission. Expelled from the Avengers for this misconduct, Rage joined the New Warriors, becoming a mainstay of the group and forming a close friendship with Speedball. When the Poison Memories gang killed Granny Staples as part of a vendetta against the Warriors, Rage cold-bloodedly killed gang leader Kimeiko Ashu, though a judge later deemed his actions self-defense. |||| |||| |||| Warriors leader Dwayne Taylor (Night-Thrasher) and Dwayne's mentor Andrew Chord were appointed Elvin's legal guardians, and when Dwayne later had a falling-out with the other Warriors, Elvin left the team with him. Serving as mentors to the troubled super-youths Psionex for a time, Night-Thrasher and Rage eventually rejoined the Warriors, who began to drift apart as their members pursued differing goals. Rage has decided to concentrate on his studies at the Oatridge School for Boys and is only infrequently active as a super hero of late, though he has been willing to assist the Avengers and the Warriors against foes such as the Elements of Doom, Morgan Le Fay, Whirlwind, Taskmaster, A.I.M., Lord Templar and an insane Scarlet Witch."

4209,Grandmaster (Marvel),En Dwi Gast ,4209_20070125131821_char.jpg,"The Grandmaster posses a cosmic life force which grants him a variety of superhuman traits, including a virtually immortal body, immunity to aging and disease, and imperviousness to conventional injury through regeneration of any injury. Also, the Grandmaster can utilize his cosmic life force for a variety of effects, including levitation, the projection of energy blasts, and travel through time and space and into alternate dimensions. He is also capable of transforming and rearranging matter on a planetary scale, he can cause death to others just by wishing it, and he can resurrect beings who are dead for less then 29.5 hours. Currently due to his machinations against Death, he cannot die. He is also capable of mentally computing diverse low information probabilities to the tenth decimal place with ease, and to retain vast amounts of data. He also possesses certain abilities of mental perception beyond those currently known, which enable him to receive information about his environment through extrasensory means. He also maintains a psychic link with the highly advanced computers of his base world, which extend and enhance his mental abilities.",,"Like those of all the Elders of the Universe, the Grandmaster’s origin is lost in early history of the universe. It is known that he is one of the oldest living beings in the universe. Like other Elders, he is the survivor of one of the intelligent races that evolved in one of the first galaxies to form after the “Big Bang”, the cataclysmic event in which the universe was created. Although his race became extinct and even his native galaxy died as the ages passed, the Grandmaster, like the other Elders, lived on, having become virtually immortal. As the relatively few survivors of the earliest period of the universe, the Elders regarded themselves as figuratively being brothers. |||| |||| The Grandmaster has spent his extraordinary long life in pursuit of amusement through the playing of games. He has traveled throughout the known universe studying many civilizations’ forms of games and play to the point of mastering them. He then began to devise his own types of tournaments and contests, challenging various opponents to games of skill and chance for high stakes. |||| |||| Capable of traversing space, time and the dimensions, the Grandmaster once journeyed to the alternate Earth inhabited by the Squadron Supreme to stage a contest with the time-traveling Scarlet Centurion. The Grandmaster’s standard method of playing games was to choose a team of champions to do combat with another team selected by his opponent. The Grandmaster used the Squadron Supreme as pawns for his games, while the Scarlet Centurion assembled various of the Squadron’s enemies as the Institute of Evil. Winning the contest, the Grandmaster determined to create is own Squadron since the original Squadron was unwilling to participate in further games. |||| |||| Returning to his own universe he traveled to Earth and transformed three men (Doctor Spectrum, Nighthawk, and the Whizzer) into counterparts of the Squadron members. He also created a counterpart to the Squadron’s Hyperion out of non-living extra dimensional matter and invested it with consciousness and artificial memories. These four counterparts became the criminal team known as the Squadron Sinister. |||| |||| The Grandmaster then journeyed to the time period of Kang the Conqueror (a temporal counterpart to the Scarlet Centurion) to engage in a contest against him. After Kang’s champions, the Avengers, defeated the Squadron Sinister, the Grandmaster drafted the World War II heroes, the Invaders. If Kang won, the Grandmaster would briefly grant him the power of either life or death. If Kang lost, the Grandmaster would destroy the Earth. Fortunately, Kang’s champions triumphed. |||| |||| Later, having returned to the 20th Century, the Grandmaster used Daredevil and the Defenders as his pawns against Doctor Doom‘s artificial creation the Prime Mover. Winning this match he decided to take control of the Earth as a breeding ground for superhuman-powered pawns for his games, but gave up the Earth after losing a bet with Daredevil. |||| |||| Although the Grandmaster can resurrect most living beings after their deaths, he cannot do so with virtually immortal beings like himself who are killed. Therefore the Grandmaster was unable to resurrect his “brother” the Collector, after he had been murdered. The Grandmaster challenged Death itself to a game. If Grandmaster won, then the Collector would live, but if he lost, then he too would also die. The Grandmaster and Death each selected teams from among Earth’s superhumans to do battle in a contest of champions. The Grandmaster’s team won, but Death revealed in order to bring the Collector to life, the Grandmaster would have to forfeit his own life. Compelled by his sense of gamesmanship to see the game through to its end, the Grandmaster died and the Collector returned to life. |||| |||| However, Death then challenged the Collector to a game, apparently with the resurrection of the Grandmaster as the stakes. The outcome of the game is unknown, but the Collector is known to have survived and the Grandmaster has been seen since. The Grandmaster then used the Avengers and an incarnation of the Legion of the Unliving in another contest against Death, in which he won immortality for himself and all of the Elders. |||| |||| Later the Elders of the Universe plotted to kill Galactus by using the Infinity Gems against him. This plan failed and the Elders were then confronted by a power seeking Thanos. The Grandmaster lost one of the gems in the process, and Thanos gained ultimate power shortly thereafter. |||| |||| Recently, the Grandmaster has been seen reuniting the Squadron Sinister, and only he knows what games are yet to come."

In addition to more complex or subtle operations, he can channel his power into basic feats such as defensive screen or blasts of tremendous force.",,"Vance Astrovik was a normal teen who found himself secretly protected by the Guardians of the Galaxy, a group of superheroes from an alternate future who feared Vance was a target of the villainous Korvac. Upon meeting Vance Astro, the Guardian who happened to be an alternate-future version of himself, Vance experienced a mental shock that caused his mutant powers to emerge. |||| |||| Vance had often been abused by his father throughout his childhood, but his powers led to more abuse from his father, a violent anti-mutant bigot. Vance soon ran away from home and eventually ended up adventuring alongside the Thing, who was taking a leave of absence from the Fantastic Four. Calling himself Marvel Boy, Astrovik joined the Thing as a member of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation before finally parting ways. |||| |||| Vance, as Marvel Boy, later tried to join the Avengers, but was told by his hero, Captain America, that he needed more experience. Feeling rejected and embarrassed, Vance was then approached by Night Thrasher and Nova, who were forming their own team called the New Warriors. Vance quickly became one of the Warriors' most stalwart members and met fellow mutant Firestar, with whom he developed a romantic relationship. |||| |||| Returning home for a brief period, Vance was struck again by his father, and, when retaliating with his powers, Vance killed him. His mother pressed charges, and Vance was arrested, serving time for murder. Later released for good behavior, Vance adopted a new guise as Justice, and rejoined the New Warriors, often serving in leadership roles. Firestar eventually asked Vance to marry her. |||| |||| Vance and Firestar, alongside their teammate Rage, were drawn into conflict with monsters summoned by evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay. Rage, once a member of the Avengers, brought the couple with him as the Avengers reassembled after a period of disbanding to defeat Le Fey. After a strong push to prove himself, Vance, with Firestar, were elected reserve members. |||| |||| After serving several missions, and feeling vastly inferior to be joining the same league as his idols, Vance was elected to full membership. Continually trying to prove himself, Justice eventually won over his insecurities during the Avengers' battle with the robot Ultron. He had researched the Avengers files, discovering a new means of defeating Ultron and using it to help the Avengers destroy him. After seeing the emotional turmoil Hank Pym and the Wasp went through in the battle, Vance finally began to regard the Avengers as people rather than icons and became more relaxed about working with the team. |||| |||| Soon afterward, Vance announced his engagement with Firestar, and the two left active duty, presumably to explore their relationship. In reality, they were asked to secretly infiltrate the headquarters of the Triune Understanding, whose leader, Jonathan Tremont, was surreptitiously attacking the Avengers' public image for his own benefit. Vance and Firestar discovered the true cause of the Understanding-- using the beliefs of its members to sympathetically power a spaceship to battle a cosmic menace. They helped a contingent of Avengers join the battle against the menace, and directly afterwards helped the heroes keep the time-travelling Kang from conquering the world. After the crises were averted, they again parted company with the Avengers. |||| |||| Vance settled into civilian life with relative ease, as much as a public trial, a Dateline special, and four books written about him could allow, although Firestar had a rough transition settling into college studies at Empire State University. Vance was eagerly awaiting the next stage in his life, their upcoming marriage, but Firestar was reluctant. After a heart-to-heart, the couple agreed to call off the wedding, and even the status of their relationship remains uncertain. |||| |||| During the Civil War he fought alongside Captain America, but after the war he joined the Initiative training camp where he became an instructor. Vance is currently, though secretly, seeing Ultragirl."

Oracle is one of the stronger members of her race, being able to read the thoughts of other sentient beings, project her own thoughts into the minds of others, stun her opponents with bolts of pure mental energy, and perform other various telepathic feats.",,"The Lady Sybil is a member of the Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. As Oracle, she was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| The Guard and the X-Men subsequently clashed once more when the Shi'ar sought to end the threat to the universe posed by the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix, which had assumed the form of X-Men member Jean Grey. As the Guard's only telepathic member at the time, Oracle was an obvious choice to be one of eight Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men. The Guard defeated the X-Men on this occasion, but the mutants were allowed to return to Earth after Phoenix seemingly committed suicide. |||| |||| Soon after, Oracle was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Oracle remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Oracle was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard including Oracle, whose own telepathic powers were no match for Xavier's. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Oracle was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with discovering the whereabouts of the powerful Kree weapon known as the Omni-Wave Projector. Oracle's team captured the Earthling named Rick Jones, a long-time ally of the former Kree soldier known as Captain Mar-vell, and learned of the location of the device by scanning Jones' mind. |||| |||| When the Empress Lilandra, having regained her throne, learned of the many Earth heroes that had sacrificed their lives to stop the malevolent psionic being named Onslaught, she dispatched eight members of the Imperial Guard, including Oracle, to protect Earth. While on Earth, the Guard uncovered a plot by a militant Kree faction to simulate a radical political activist group in revenge for Earth's involvement in the Kree/Shi'ar war. In reality, the group created a 'nega-reactor', similar to the bomb that was used on the Kree. However, this plot was stopped by the Guard, but not before the reactor was used by the Kree's leader, the Supreme Intelligence, to re-incorporate itself after being presumably killed at the end of the war. |||| |||| During their brief stay on Earth, Oracle and her fellow Guardsman Gladiator learned that a fugitive from Shi'ar justice was hiding on the planet, stuck in the form of a child and with no memory of his former life. Their search brought them into confrontation with the gamma-spawned man-beast known as the incredible Hulk. |||| |||| In her time as a member of the Imperial Guard, Oracle and her fellow Guardsman Flashfire had fallen in love and planned to marry. She took the opportunity to retire from active duty with the Guard, and her place was taken by the telepath named Delphos. |||| |||| For reasons unknown, Oracle's relationship with Flashfire did not last, and she later returned as a member of the Imperial Guard following the mental possession of their Empress Lilandra by Charles Xavier's mutant twin sister Cassandra Nova and her decree that all mutants on Earth had to be destroyed, starting with the X-Men. Oracle's appearance had changed drastically - instead of the refined, well-kept woman she once was, Oracle now appears as a naked, feral harridan. During the ensuing clash, Oracle was defeated by the group of young telepaths known as the Stepford Cuckoos, whose combined mental abilities proved more powerful than Oracle's own. ||||"

Finding a mysterious formula in an ancient book, Kyle re-created and drank it, discovering his body gained superhuman powers, but only at night. |||| |||| The Grandmaster immediately appeared, revealing that it was he who arranged for Kyle to find the formula. The Grandmaster then had him take the identity of Nighthawk in order to form the Squadron Sinister and fight the Avengers, who themselves were pawns of the Grandmaster’s opponent, Kang the Conqueror. Although the Squadron was defeated, the Grandmaster kept his word and returned Kyle and the others to Earth with their powers. Kyle continued to use his Nighthawk identity for idle amusement, running into conflict with Daredevil. |||| |||| A few months later, he and the other members of the Squadron Sinister were hired by the alien geographer, Nebulon. Nebulon and the Squadron Sinister tried to melt the polar ice caps, but Nighthawk grew uncomfortable with the situation and, acting responsibly for the first time in his life, he contacted the Defenders to help defeat the Squadron. In the conflict, Nighthawk threw himself in front of Nebulon’s laser cannon, stopping the plot at the risk of his life. Doctor Strange cast a spell to revive Nighthawk, and Kyle became an associate of the team. |||| |||| Nighthawk found a new sense of purpose as a member of the Defenders. He updated his costume with a jet-powered glider and turned his private riding academy into a team headquarters. He even became a de facto leader of the group, serving faithfully except for a brief period when he retired his identity to deal with an IRS investigation. Later, after stopping the demonic Six-Fingered Hand, the spell Doctor Strange had used to revive Nighthawk was disrupted. Kyle found himself completely paralyzed during the day, having his superpowers and full mobility only at night. |||| |||| Kyle tried to return to college, where he found his former girlfriend, Mindy Williams, had not died during their earlier accident but was severely crippled. Mindy was, in fact, a telepath, and she tried to gain revenge on Nighthawk, who was saved with the help of Spider-Man. Soon after, Nighthawk learned Mindy was an unwilling tool of August Masters, a super-patriot who hoped to use the collective psychic might of Mindy and other telepaths to attack the Soviet Union. He contacted the Defenders to help defeat masters, although it was the six telepaths, funneling their collective power into Nighthawk, that were able to destroy the complex. Although the Defenders escaped, Kyle, the telepaths, and Masters were all inside when it exploded. |||| |||| Kyle was hospitalized and believed dead, but it was soon discovered he was in fact in a coma, when he recuperated faster when blocked from the sun’s rays during the day. During his time in a coma, Kyle was approached by an angelic being that told Nighhawk his role on Earth was far from over. When Kyle awoke, he possessed a special psychic vision that allowed him to perceive evil deeds before they would occur, and Nighthawk resumed his crime-fighting career by taking a proactive approach to defeat crime before it happened. This crusade, however, had all the seeming of a costumed man beating up innocent people, and Daredevil, rightfully concerned, confronted Nighthawk. Although Nighthawk tried to recruit Daredevil, both were killed in a subsequent conflict. In fact, this was all according to Mephisto’s plan, who had posed as the angel giving Nighthawk his new vision and purpose, knowing that Kyle was on his way to a better afterlife and was determined to stop him. Nighthawk, by force of will, dragged Daredevil with him physically out of hell and back into the land of the living, thwarting Mephisto’s plans. |||| |||| Kyle sought help from Papa Hagg to remove Mephisto’s influence, and he kept his Nighthawk costume at the ready. Finally, after a long hiatus, the Defenders were reunited after his former teammate Hellcat brought the original founders together to defeat Yandroth the Magician. As a result of the battle, several of the Defenders were cursed to continually band together, and Nighthawk and the remaining Defenders elected to stay together as a team to support them. Nighthawk, in particular, was thrilled to once again be a part of the team. He had Papa Hagg magically transport the support Defenders whenever the core team would be cursed to appear at a trouble spot. However, as part of the curse, the core Defenders found themselves distancing themselves from humanity. They finally struck upon the idea that in order to have peace, they would enforce it by ruling the world. Nighthawk and the support Defenders organized a team to defeat the so-called Order, after which the Defenders were freed from their curse but disbanded once again. |||| |||| Recently, Nighthawk began to notice that his superhuman powers were steadily increasing. About the same time, a division of Richmond Enterprises was robbed by former Squadron member Speed Demon, prompting Nighthawk to seek him out. Speed Demon was actually performing robberies in order to fund his new team, the Thunderbolts. Nighthawk confronted Speed Demon, but they were in turn confronted by a revived Squadron Sinister, who took Nighthawk and Speed Demon away with them. The Squadron hoped to take over the world in order to better solve the world’s problems, but they were stopped by the Thunderbolts. Speed Demon hoped to trick the Squadron into thinking he would help them, but he turned on them, helping the Thunderbolts force them to escape. Nevertheless, Songbird ultimately kicked Speed Demon out of the Thunderbolts because of his previous robberies, claiming that what the Thunderbolts needed more were members whose hearts were behind their efforts to reform. She then invited Nighthawk to join them, and he agreed. However, it wasn’t long before the Thunderbolts were rejoined by Baron Zemo, and Nighthawk decided to quit rather than work with the former criminal. (It was also revealed that Songbird only wanted Nighthawk as a member to help fund the team.) |||| Nighthawk returned to the Squadron Sinister, who preferred to be called Supreme Power, finding them again recruited by the Grandmaster. This time, the Grandmaster claimed that the stakes of the game would affect the entire universe, and he hoped to use the Squadron to find the Wellspring of Power, from which he drew upon to grant the Squadron their abilities."

3887,Ms. Marvel (Marvel)(01 - Carol Danvers),Carol Susan Jane Danvers. ,3887_20070317132831_char.jpg,"Ms. Marvel has a wide array of superhuman powers. Initially they included superhuman strength, endurance, formidable resistance to physical injury, the ability to fly, and a precognitive sense. |||| |||| When she became Binary, she could manipulate every form of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum on a cosmic level, had vastly increased strength, and could fly at speeds exceeding light. After her link to the white hole from which she drew her powers was severed, she lost the bulk of her cosmic powers, but still retained her energy manipulation powers on a smaller scale. In addition to her original powers of superhuman strength, injury resistance, and flight, Ms. Marvel has the ability to absorb and manipulate photonic energy. She can focus her photonic powers into explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. These blasts are comparable in power to her fellow Avenger Iron Man's repulsor rays. By focusing her powers outward in all directions, she can surround herself with an energy aura which deflects most attacks. She also has some gravitational powers which allow her to boost her already tremendous strength by absorbing the gravitational forces around her. She has also demonstrated the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection. On at least one occasion, Binary was able to use her power to force open a Shi'ar Stargate, a feat which only hosts of the Phoenix Force and Firestar have managed before or since. |||| |||| Originally, Hank McCoy, aka the Beast, after performing several biological tests, had theorized Ms. Marvel would never be able to access her cosmic level powers again. However, recent events have proven this to be incorrect. It has been confirmed as of New Avengers #17 and #18 that Ms. Marvel still possesses all the abilities she had as Binary, and merely lacks a suitable power supply. One might then surmize that her abilities to absorb and manipulate energy have no upper limit. This was confirmed when Ms. Marvel battled the sentient energy being known as The Collective and was stuck by a bolt of its energy, causing her skin to turn fiery red, which was a side effect of her cosmic powers. In addition, the flaming energy corona that manifested around her head when she used them also appeared.",,None entered.

She could generate and manipulate strands of psionic force, which she often wove into adhesive 'psi-webs' to snare her targets. By concentrating this psionic force in her hands and feet, she could cling to and crawl across any surface, even scaling sheer walls. Whether any of her lost powers will regenerate remains to be seen.",,"An athletic young single mother, Julia Carpenter was drawn into a covert double life by an old college friend, federal agent Valerie Cooper, who believed Julia would be an ideal test subject for a secret government super-agent program. Reuniting with Carpenter seemingly by chance, Cooper promised her cash-strapped friend lucrative employment and manipulated Julia into undergoing a series of experimental treatments, including injections of a formula incorporating rare Amazon jungle plants and spider venoms, which gave Julia superhuman powers. She became an operative of the Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA) as Spider-Woman. The CSA was based in Washington, but Julia initially moonlighted as a seemingly independent super hero in Denver. When the near-omnipotent Beyonder abducted an entire Denver suburb (including the Carpenter home) into space as part of his Secret Wars, Julia fought the Beyonder's army of villains alongside the heroes the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Hulk and Spider-Man (who was so impressed by Julia that he 'thought up' her costume design for his new one when his was damaged). |||| |||| Arrogant, greedy and self-absorbed, Julia's ex-husband Larry had lost custody of their daughter Rachel after Julia divorced him for cheating on her; but when Julia's secret Spider-Woman career led to frequent unexplained absences on her part, Larry sued for custody of Rachel and won. Meanwhile, Julia served reluctantly with the ruthless CSA-sponsored super-team Freedom Force until they arrested the Avengers on false treason charges. A sympathetic Julia freed them and became a fugitive herself, though the Avengers were soon exonerated. Cooper later gave Carpenter a second chance, employing her as a solo operative supervised by unscrupulous CSA agent Mike Clemson; but after aiding the Avengers against the Pacific Overlords, Julia joined the Avengers and cut ties with the CSA. While serving with the western Avengers roster, Julia fought the criminal trio Deathweb; their powers, like hers, came from the formula of the CSA's Dr. Carter Napier. Deathweb and their employer, the Manipulator, fought Julia several times, killing Larry and Napier, threatening Rachel and menacing Julia's parents, the Cornwalls, who as Amazon jungle guides had helped locate the ingredients for Napier's formula; but Julia ultimately defeated the villains, saving her daughter and parents. |||| |||| When the Avengers decided to close their west coast base, Julia resigned in protest and joined several other ex-western Avengers in founding the new Force Works super-team, though it soon disbanded and Julia renewed her ties with the Avengers on an inactive basis. She was later forced to retire from superheroics after a crippling attack by a rival criminal Spider-Woman, Charlotte Witter, who drained away Carpenter's superhuman powers. Aided by the young new Spider-Woman, Mattie Franklin, Witter lost possession of the stolen powers. |||| |||| Shortly after the Superhuman Registration act was passed, Julia was persuaded by Tony Stark (Iron Man) to join his team. Alongside with Ms.Marvel and Wonder Man, her mission was to train other registered super heroes to perform government-authorized security activities. As well as the standard apprehension of unregistered super heroes. |||| |||| She was soon sent to go after The Shroud (Max Coleridge), an unregistered super hero and Julia's new boyfriend. To her change of heart, Julia helped him escape Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man. She's currently a fugitive."

940,Ragman (DC)(Post Crisis)(01 - Rory Regan),Rory Regan ,940_20070222200901_char.jpg,"Ragman Suit: The Great Collector Artifact, a mystical Jewish artifact created to protect the Jewish communities ever since the time of Abraham. |||| |||| Telekinetic Suit Control: Also, the Ragman possesses a number of minor magical powers, such as kinetically controlling the suit (i.e. entangling Eclipso with his cloak while grappling with her) |||| |||| Multitude of Forms: It has recently been revealed that the suit can take on other forms, such as weapons, and still collect souls. Whether Rory will use this ability in the future is yet to be seen. |||| |||| Precognitive Dreams: Rory had occasional precognitive dreams, though they were too vague to provide useful information |||| |||| Superhuman Durability: Regan is the latest Ragman, an avenger and protector empowered by a mystical suit. While the wearer is bonded to the Ragman costume, he is almost impossible to destroy. While his durability is only slightly superhuman, any damage sustained is repaired in seconds. |||| |||| Superhuman Agility: It gives the users prodigious leaping ability |||| |||| Levitation: can slowly float through the air |||| |||| Discorporate: discorporate and reform great distances away. The latter form of discorporation can also be used in a more limited manner to avoid physical attacks by allowing the rags to simply flow around objects as well as to ensnare nearby opponents by smothering them in a cloud of rags. |||| |||| Sense Evil Souls: Perhaps the most macabre of the costume's abilities is the stealing of souls. The suit is drawn toward evil souls; it can sense them in its vicinity and is compelled to seek them out and attack them. This compulsion is also inflicted upon the wearer if he has the costume on. The evil acts of people who have been detected in this manner can also be sensed by the Ragman. This sensing of sins does not work on those people or beings who are not evil. |||| |||| Steal Soul: The suit can steal a person's soul as long as it is still touching his body. Ragman will usually subdue a target (knock them unconscious or Stun them) to minimize their ability to resist, but this is not necessary. Once a soul is absorbed, the body is left a brain-dead husk and the mind and spirit become yet another rag on the costume. The stolen soul is not affected if the physical body subsequently dies. |||| |||| The costume can steal souls that are not evil. Indeed, on two occasions the ability to absorb the souls of good people was essential for keeping the suit under control. On another occasion, Rory attempted to use the suit to absorb the amoral soul of a mystic servitor. He was able to begin the process but the servitor fought it off, indicating that the suit has difficulty absorbing the souls of mystically-powerful creatures. |||| |||| Boost Physical Attributes: After a soul is incorporated into the Ragman suit, it can be used in several ways. Its energy can be directed into boosting the wearer's strength, speed, coordination, and fighting prowess. When the wearer uses it in this manner, he can become such a skilled combatant that he can easily defeat a roomful of armed men without being struck in return a single time in the process. |||| |||| Boost Influence: This energy can also be directed into making the Ragman's influence more formidable -- when concentrating on such actions, the mere presence of the Ragman can make groups of armed gunmen stop attacking or even flee the scene. |||| |||| Absorbed Memory Recall: The wearer can also look into the memories of the absorbed soul and extract any information therein as desired. It is also possible that the wearer might be able to use some of the abilities possessed by the souls in the rag suit -- using a captured sorcerer's memories to cast spells, for example -- but this is only speculation. |||| |||| Soul Redemption: There is an implied redemption of evil souls contained within the rag suit, but no mechanism for this has yet been shown. Rory's comments seem to indicate that this redemption is linked to the soul willingly assisting the wearer in his mission and thus slowly working off its moral debt. This process has been stated to take a century or more. While the souls power the suit, no single soul seems to make a noticeable difference in the Ragman's power levels. Accordingly, the acquisition or loss of souls as time goes by is usually not a serious concern to the current trustee of the costume. |||| |||| Telepathic Bond: Like all of those who have trained in the use of the suit, Rory has formed a rudimentary telepathic bond with the Ragman costume. He can communicate with the suit's collective personality -- though he speaks out loud, only he can hear the suit's replies. Rory also uses this trait to summon the suit to him over short distances. |||| |||| Sense Disposition: Though detailed exchanges are only possible at short range, those attuned to the suit in this manner can still get a general sense of its disposition while active, and vice versa. For example, the Rabbi who trained Gerry sensed when the suit became active again (when Rory first put it on) and where it was despite being an unknown distance away. The suit also sensed when the Rabbi passed away and relayed that information to Rory even though the Rabbi was no longer in the same city as Rory and the suit when he died. Rory has not as yet developed this second talent -- it may require additional special training in Jewish mystic rituals such as the Rabbi had. |||| |||| Inspire Hope: Because the Ragman was created as a symbol of hope to protect communities, he can over time form a limited psychic bond with the people of a given neighborhood. When this process is complete, the people of the community will find themselves acting as one with the Ragman to confront local threats. Once this occurs, the Ragman's work is finished and he will move on, teleporting to a new place that needs his help. How the suit determines where the Ragman is needed next is unknown. The suit has an additional failsafe that compels the wearer to teleport away if the battle for a neighborhood is hopeless. The Ragman was meant to inspire hope, so staying to fight a lost cause would be futile; the suit's creators felt it was better to have the Ragman live to fight another day rather than be destroyed.","Fire Vulnerability: However, the rags are extremely vulnerable to fire, a weakness added by the Rabbis who created the Ragman as a security measure in case the suit fell into the wrong hands. |||| |||| Pain of Soul Taking: However, Rory has mentioned that the process of acquiring a new soul gives him stomach cramps and nausea.","A community of Jews in 16th century Eastern Europe created the Ragman to replace the Golem, their previous defender. Gerry Regan was the last European Ragman, as he, still named Jerzy Reganiewicz, fled to the United States after failing to protect the Jewish population from Nazi persecution. After settling down in Gotham City, Regan passed the mantle of Ragman to his son Rory. Rory Regan is a ragman, doing good in his community by buying used items from people who need money. The suit of rags that he wears was originally just a costume made from materials found around the rag shop he shared with his father, Rags'n'Tatters. Currently each of the patches in the suit is made from the soul of an evildoer that the Ragman had punished and absorbed. The absorption of these souls caused a problem for Rory at one point, when the evil souls hungered for murder and finally freed themselves of Ragman. It was only with the support of Batman and Regan's old friend, Rabbi Luria, that he regained control, though at the cost of Luria's life. Ragman's powers have increased since then. Currently, he can absorb souls into his costume. With each new soul added, a rag is added. He can call upon the souls in his costume to lend him their attributes or power. He is also a very proficient magic user. |||| Judgment and Vengeance |||| |||| Ragman was active in destroying many of the demons invading Earth. This would earn him the wrath of the Diablos, a group of demons who style themselves after the Mafia. Wanting to gain revenge for demons lost during the Day of Judgment, they attack Ragman, injuring him and tearing off parts of his costume. They believe him to be dead but this is not true. |||| |||| Ragman is one of the members of the Shadowpact, a team that formed to confront the Spectre. |||| |||| During 'Infinite Crisis', Ragman and Nightshade are seen standing side by side as part of the line of superheroes defending Metropolis from attack from dozens of villains. |||| |||| Ragman is one of the few volunteers willing to take on the rampaging Spectre, who has decided that all magic is evil. During a planning sessions, he is taken aside by the Enchantress and given a mystical gun. She entrusts him with it, as it can kill her if she goes too far with her magic, a scenario she believes is all too possible. He tells her if she truly turns evil, his costume will take her. He then tries to kiss her, but his feelings are not returned and Enchantress even mocks him for it in front of the other heroes. |||| Shadowpact |||| |||| Ragman, along with his teammates, was trapped inside a shield of solid blood that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. Ragman and the rest of the team spend a very short period of time inside the shield, but to due to magical after-effects, a full year passes outside. Various mystical heroes, such as Phantom Stranger and Rex the Wonder Dog keep watch outside the town's borders. |||| |||| While inside Riverrock, Rory met an evil counterpart of himself belonging to the supervillain group that had formed the shield, the Pentacle. His counterpart is named Bagman. He/it dresses in similar green garb, and can turn his body to goo and while in this form he absorbs people. While inside Bagman they either suffocate or they are digested. Bagman even mentioned how oddly similar the Shadowpact and the Pentacle are. Rory only survives this encounter because Bagman's boss does not want the heroes to be killed. After the Riverock encounter, Rory must deal with the severe disruption to his life, as everyone had thought he was dead. He, like most of the team, ends up having to find a new source of income, a place to stay and the oddity of encountering a memorial statue to the entire team. |||| Rory was temporarily trapped in the limbo dimension of his own cloak. He met the soul of an ancient Centurion working off his crimes. This man, Marcus Liberius, first saved him from the beating several other of the murderous souls were giving Rory. Marcus reveals that the cloak was actually the 'Great Collector Artifact', which has been in existence in many forms since the time of Abraham. Ragmen in Rory's line have been in action since 1812 BCE. Marcus also helped Rory, who had become disenchanted with the job of collecting corrupted souls, to see that he is not a punisher but a redeemer — allowing a better afterlife for those who work for it. This work usually takes the form of suffering on Rory's behalf. For example, Rory had been recently blinded by magic. Marcus willingly takes this blindNess on, adding to previous injuries he had suffered. This last sacrifice allows Marcus, in the full view of the rest of the Shadowpact, to ascend to a higher realm."

These powers would wane when he was deprived of starlight. Mar-Vell also possessed Cosmic Awareness, which could increase his intellect, granting him limited precognitive powers and the ability to ascertain an opponent's weakness. At one point he also possessed the ability to teleport and cast illusions.",,"Mar-Vell was a white-skinned minority of the blue-skinned Kree empire, but despite discrimination and prejudice, Mar-Vell became a renowned soldier and an acclaimed hero for his victories in battle against the Kree's enemies, notably the Skrulls. |||| |||| Mar-Vell’s regiment, under the command of Yon-Rogg, was given a mission to observe Earth, specifically human’s progress of space travel. Yon-Rogg, jealous of the love between Mar-Vell and the ship’s medic, Una, ordered Mar-Vell to infiltrate Cape Canaveral, Florida, alone. He then secretly tried to fire on Mar-Vell’s ship, but killed a human instead-- Dr. Walter Lawson. Mar-Vell took advantage of resembling Lawson to pose as the doctor and create a secret identity, but Yon-Rogg again secretly tried to kill Mar-Vell by activating the Kree robot, the Sentry. In his Kree uniform, Mar-Vell publicly defeated the robot, and the onlookers acclaimed him as 'Captain Marvel,' misinterpreting what the Sentry called him. |||| |||| Mar-Vell continued to observe humanity, in both his secret and costumed identity, growing increasingly sympathetic for Earth and its inhabitants. His initial adventures were typically extensions of Yon-Rogg’s attempts to kill, discredit, or otherwise destroy him, such as the time Yon-Rogg manipulated Ronan the Accuser to fight Mar-Vell by framing Captain Marvel as a traitor. Mar-Vell also had to navigate the romantic triangle between him and Una and the aggressive attention of his co-worker at the air base, Carol Danvers. These situations came to a head when Una overheard one of Yon-Rogg’s plans to kill Mar-Vell, and she was captured by his agents when she tried to warn him. Although Mar-Vell’s execution failed with the arrival of the Aakon aliens, she was shot in the battle and died in Mar-Vell’s arms as he tried to rescue her. |||| |||| Before he returned to confront Yon-Rogg, he encountered a powerful being named Zo that granted him increased abilities. Around the same time, he ran afoul of Commander Zarek, who hoped to set up Mar-Vell as a traitor. It was he and Ronan that created the illusion of Zo, with which they again manipulated Captain Marvel into thinking he must destroy his home planet Kree-Lar. Marvel was made temporarily a fugitive until Zarek and Ronan were uncovered by the Kree’s Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence then revealed to Captain Marvel that it knew of Zarek and Ronan’s treachery the entire time and orchestrated events so that Mar-Vell would be involved in their plot as the Intelligence hoped to use Mar-Vell for even greater things. Claiming Captain Marvel had “passed” these tests, he clothed Mar-Vell in a new costume and allowed him to retain some of his new-found abilities. |||| |||| However, as soon as Captain Marvel left to return to Earth, he instead found himself in the extradimensional realm known as the Negative Zone. The Supreme Intelligence then mentally lured the Earth youth Rick Jones to an abandoned Kree base on Earth in order to bid him to wear the 'Nega-Bands.' By slamming the bands together, Jones and Captain Marvel shared a telepathic link as well as, more importantly, switch places between Earth’s universe and the Negative Zone. In no time at all, Captain Marvel was called out by Yon-Rogg, who was holding Carol Danvers as a hostage. In a last-ditch effort to destroy his rival, Yon-Rogg battled the hero, but Captain Marvel rescued Carol and Yon-Rogg was killed in an explosion as they escaped. (The exposure to Yon-Rogg’s weapon, the Psyche-Magnetron, transformed Carol into Ms. Marvel.) |||| |||| Captain Marvel and Rick Jones continued shared adventures for many months. At one point, Mar-Vell happened upon the idea to use Mister Fantastic’s doorway into the Negative Zone to release Rick and allowing the two to share an existence in the Earth dimension simultaneously. Shortly afterward, both Rick and Marvel were swept up in the intergalactic Kree-Skrull War alongside the Avengers, where Rick encountered the Supreme Intelligence. The Intelligence released the latent psionic potential in Jones’ mind in order to help stop the war, striking all soldiers motionless and teleporting Jones’ allies to the Kree homeworld, among other fantastic feats. Rick was left very near death, and Captain Marvel sacrificed part of his lifeforce to save Jones, “merging atoms” with him so that they could become linked as in their previous relationship. |||| |||| After many more months and many more adventures, Rick Jones’ body could no longer contain both his own lifeforce and that of Mar-Vell, and he collapsed. His girlfriend Lou Ann Savannah took him to her uncle, who used special photonic energy to revive him, and Jones and Captain Marvel could continue to switch places. In fact, Captain Marvel now found he could absorb solar energy and redirect it to fire energy bolts or to exhibit superhuman strength. |||| |||| When Captain Marvel became involved against the plans of the alien nihilist Thanos, he was contacted by Eon, a guardian entity of the universe who commissioned Captain Marvel as the next 'Protector of the Universe.' He also granted him a special “cosmic awareness.” With a newfound title and purpose, he became the primary force against defeating Thanos. In fact, it was his new cosmic awareness that allowed Captain Marvel and the Avengers to defeat the mad Titan, since it gave him insight into Thanos’ use of the Cosmic Cube. Thanos became convinced that he had drained the Cube of its power and discarded it, allowing Captain Marvel to grab the Cube and restore reality to a time before Thanos had gained control over the universe. |||| |||| As time passed, Mar-Vell and Jones overcame the dimension-split between them, existing side-by-side once more, although often they would need to merge in order to maximize Captain Marvel’s power. They adventured in this manner for a long while. When Commander Zarek returned, he led the Lunatic Legion, which included transforming a lowly engineer into the villain Nitro. Nitro was sent to steal canisters of nerve gas when Captain Marvel confronted him. Although Nitro was defeated and Captain Marvel seemed to have re-sealed the canisters before endangering the public, he himself was exposed to the gas, which would later prove disastrous. |||| |||| In a direct conflict with Captain Marvel, Zarek and the Lunatic Legion would have nearly succeeded in bringing him down if it were not for Marvel’s increased powers when merged with Rick Jones. Captain Marvel returned to the Kree homeworld to inform the Supreme Intelligence of the plot, but, surprisingly, the Intelligence revealed its true motives-- that it had known of Zarek’s plan and, in fact, had secretly been a driving force behind nearly all of Captain Marvel’s history. The Supreme Intelligence had long known the Kree had reached an evolutionary dead-end, and its only hope as a species was to integrate other genetically compatible races with its own so as to revitalize the Kree's stagnant development. He had specifically chosen Mar-Vell due to his genetic make-up and had also chosen Rick Jones specifically because of the latent psychic potential he housed. It further arranged to have them both 'bond' by means of the Kree Nega-Bands, a process that was repeated or replicated throughout their history, because the Intelligence knew he couldn’t add Jones' brain to its collective organism directly until it was tempered by contact with a Kree brain such as Mar-Vell's. Using the unique Kree-bred flower called the Millennium Bloom, the Supreme Intelligence then proceeded to try to absorb both Jones' and Mar-Vell's brains, using their bodies as receptacles for its own consciousness in a direct assault against Earth. However, the heroes resisted and managed to escape, and Captain Marvel abandoned the Kree empire permanently. |||| |||| While back on Earth, Mar-Vell wandered independently for a time. He worked at an observatory, became involved with the Defenders for a day, and again teamed up with the Avengers against Thanos. Thanos’ corruption of his home, the moon Titan, pitted the Eternals against the world-computer ISAAC, and Captain Marvel helped the Eternals restore order. During this time, he fell in love with the Eternal’s Elysius, and they began a relationship that spanned both Titan and Earth and many shared adventures. |||| |||| Ultimately, Captain Marvel’s earlier exposure to the nerve gas proved cancerous, and the cancer turned malignant. Mar-Vell spent his last days on Titan, the moon of Saturn, surrounded by Elysius and his friends Mentor and Starfox. Many of his allies came to visit him while on his deathbed including the Thing, Spider-Man, Drax the Destroyer, and an ambassador of the Skrull empire (the greatest enemies of the Kree Empire) who awarded Mar-Vell with the Skrull medal of valor and stated that Captain Marvel was considered to be the greatest single enemy the Skrull Empire had ever known. He was also granted a posthumous honorary membership in the Avengers, and a monument was erected in his memory on Titan. |||| |||| His heroic legacy includes his son, Genis-Vell, conceived by Elysius who impregnated herself with Mar-Vell's cloned DNA, and Phyla-Vell, a daughter from an alternate reality whose history became folded into reality after a time warp. Monica Rambeau has also used the alias of Captain Marvel. |||| Mar-Vell is apparently plucked out of space/time after his battle with Nitro but before he starts to show signs of his illness. Although he appears healthy, Mar-Vell is made aware that his body harbors the cancer that will one day kill him. Nevertheless, Mar-Vell dons his Nega Bands in order to serve as the warden of the new Negative Zone prison. He is later called in to help the Pro-registration heroes who revived him, in the final battle of the Civil War; however upon seeing the chaos they are causing, he departs, to France, where he spends all of his time observing a painting of Alexander the Great in the Louvre and contemplates Alexander's similarities to himself. He is eventually called back to action, first to defend the museum from the supervillain known as the Cyclone who he readily kills, for murdering several people. He is eventually tracked down by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Heather Santos, who tells him Tony Stark wants to have him return to his own timeline, and persuades him to take action. He then returns to New York, where he helps the Avengers defeat a giant robot. Simultaneously a woman he saved during the final battle of the Civil War, starts a cult which worships Mar-Vell, under the assumed name of Mother Starr. |||| |||| It has been implied that this Captain Marvel may in fact be a Skrull; at the same time that Skrull infiltrators strike S.H.I.E.L.D., S.W.O.R.D., the Baxter Building and a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, 'Mar-Vell' launches an attack on Thunderbolt Mountain. Brian Reed has stated that an eight-page story within the one-shot Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust? will shed some light on what has happened to Mar-Vell between the final issue of his limited series and both Secret Invasion #1 and Thunderbolts. |||| |||| It was confirmed that 'Mar-Vell' was formerly a Skrull named Khn'nr, who received memory implants. Due to an error in the methods of Skrull scientists, the personality of Mar-Vell as well as all of Mar-Vell's memories prior to his Skrull captivity were retained in their entirety even after the psychological trigger was activated which was supposed to return him to his Skrull persona. It was further explained that most of Khn'nr's personality had accidentally been erased as a byproduct of the botched mental conditioning. Consequently, the Mar-vell persona remained defiantly dominant. When he learned the truth he decided to rebel against the Skrulls and protect Earth from their invasion. ||||"

Occasionally, she becomes violently hostile or over-amorous.","When policeman's widow Greer Nelson couldn't find a job, her old physics professor hired her as a lab assistant. When Hydra attempted to kidnap Dr. Joanne Tumulo, Greer leapt to her defense. Greer was fatally shot with an 'alpha radiation' pistol. Her mentor revealed that she was a member of a race of humanoids, mystically evolved from cats. She offered to save Greer, by making her one of them. Greer agreed. In a mystic ritual, a feline soul was bonded with her failing body.  The combined being resembled one of the legendary warriors of the Cat People, so she was named Tigra. Although able to return to her human form with the aid of an enchanted amulet, Tigra preferred her feline form and abandoned her previous identity. Although she has served with the Avengers and the West Coast Avengers, she briefly worked in the New York City police, using the pseudonym Greer Sorenson, in order to bring the Brethren of the Blue Fist to justice for its role in the death of her husband. |||| |||| During the Civil War, Tigra supported the registration act, although she expressed sincere concern about the fate of Captain America and the other heroes who opposed the Act and turned fugitive. |||| Subsequently as a registered hero and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., she served as an instructor in Camp Hammond and resumed her relationship with Hank Pym, unaware that he was in fact a Skrull. |||| After beating a criminal gang including Jigsaw, Tigra was attacked at her home by The Hood and his fledgling team of villains. Tigra was made an example of their power: she was shot, severely beaten and had her cat amulet stolen - all while being filmed. The Hood threatened to kill her mother if she crossed them again. The Hood and his entire crew later reappeared at her apartment, demanding to know the location of the New Avengers' secret headquarters so they could exact revenge for a defeat at their hands. Tigra intentionally gave him information that led them into an ambush. She joined in the battle and personally beat down the Hood, saving the life of Iron Fist in the process. |||| Tigra continued to serve in the Initiative as a senior staff member of the central organization, and was the leader of the Arkansas Initiative team 'The Battalion.' She briefly fought alongside She-Hulk’s team of Lady Liberators as they battled Red Hulk. |||| After the end of the Skrull Invasion, Tigra learned that she had become pregnant by the Skrull posing as Hank Pym. Fearing she would give birth to a full-blown Skrull she decided to terminate the pregnancy, although during a fight with the cyborg clone of Thor (Ragnarok) her actions and sudden concern for her unborn child's well-being suggested that she might not be going through with the abortion and would instead end up giving birth to the child. |||| The arrival of Norman Osborn signaled the closure of Camp Hammond. Norman Osborn however had other plans for Tigra, having learned of her pregnancy from Trauma's files. Tigra explained to him that she had yet to make a final decision. Norman then rephrased his sentence to an order: either give the fetus now at five weeks pregnant or give the child when it is born. Norman wanted to study the child and use it to create a biological weapon. Needless to say, Tigra deserted and joined forces with Gauntlet, founding a new group named the Avengers Resistance with some former members of the New Warriors. |||| Behind the backs of her Resistance team-mates, Tigra began a campaign of revenge against the Hood for his earlier cruelty to her, singling out Percy Grimes (one of the Brothers Grimm), Razorfist and the Mandrill for harsh beatings. |||| Tigra is currently de-facto leader of the Avengers Resistance."

Under his original Guardsman name of Quasar, he was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. |||| |||| Quasar was later amongst those Imperial Guard members who allied themselves with the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after the ploy was discovered, Quasar, like most of the other Guard members present, still chose to side with Samédàr against the X-Men who were defending then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Quasar was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Quasar - under his new Guardsman name of Neutron - was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. Neutron has since had a long-standing grudge against the Avenger named Quasar, and once teamed up with the Russian super-being known as the Presence to seek his revenge. |||| |||| Neutron was also amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans. |||| |||| Following a meeting of the intergalactic council, Earth was declared a threat to the entire cosmos and consequently it was deemed to turn the planet into an intergalactic prison. Criminals from numerous alien races were teleported to Earth, among them the former Imperial Guard members who had allied themselves with Deathbird and Lord Samédàr all those years ago.

8521,Melter (Marvel)(01 - Bruno Horgan),Bruno Horgan ,8521_20070329231921_char.jpg,"Bruno Horgan is an accomplished engineer and businessman. |||| |||| The Melter's primary weapon was his melting device, which in essence turned objects from solid to liquid by distrupting their molecular cohesion (rather than using pure heat). His original devices only affected iron, but as time went by, he acquired more sophisticated technology, including a melting gun developed by Stark Industries-- employing a 'variable frequency microwave generator' capable of melting, depending on exposure and mode, metal, stone, wood, and even flesh. Originally, he incorporated the device into a chest-mounted projector, then developed it as a gun. Finally, he used it on his belt. He also could project the beam from his helmet, although it was only effective at close range.",,"What began as petty revenge turned into a matter of pride and finally into pure obsession. Bruno Horgan was once at the top of his field, providing weapons and munitions the U.S. government. Unfortunately, his penchant for cutting corners lost him his contract when safety inspectors closed him down for using inferior materials. Instead, the contract went to his competitor, Stark Industries, owned by Tony Stark (aka: Iron Man). During the dismantling of his factory, Horgan happened upon a malfunctioning radar device that projected a beam that melted iron materials. He perfected the device, incorporating it into a costume, and became the Melter. Immediately going on a rampage, sabotaging Stark’s factories, he was confronted by Iron Man and defeated. |||| |||| The Melter was freed by Baron Zemo to help form the original Masters of Evil as a counterpart for the Avengers’ Iron Man. However, Zemo’s plan, to destroy the Avengers and hold New York in thrall, failed, and the Melter was beaten by Iron Man once again. He was freed again to join the Masters in an assault on the Avengers while Zemo fought Captain America in South America but again failed to defeat them. He next joined the Masters when the team was organized by the Crimson Cowl (secretly Ultron), and although they initially were successful, the Masters were betrayed by the Black Knight. |||| |||| Prior to this last outing with the Masters of Evil, the Melter was among those villains summoned by Doctor Doom to crash the wedding of Reed Richards and the Susan Storm thanks to his powerful Emotion Charger device. Richards was able to use a device from Uatu The Watcher to send all villains away with no memory of the event. After this, the Melter re-designed his weapon in the form of a gun and boosted its power to affect all metals as well as other materials. He sought revenge on Iron Man but was again defeated. |||| |||| After his career with the Masters of Evil, the Melter joined with Whiplash and Man-Bull in forming the Death Squad out of their mutual obsession to defeat Iron Man. They confronted him at a comic book convention but were quickly trounced. His obsession unabated and his weapon further updated, he tried another villain team-up, this time with Whiplash and the Blizzard, all three receiving financial support by Justin Hammer. They robbed a casino where Tony Stark was dating Bethany Cabe, but the couple foiled the villains, who were remanded to Ryker’s Island. Freed by Hammer’s associates, the Melter joined Hammer’s army of villains guarding his Mediterranean “house boat” base. When Iron Man was framed for murder by Hammer, Tony Stark allowed his armor to be impounded as malfunctioning and tracked Hammer to his headquarters. With a spare Iron Man suit, Stark defeated Hammer’s army, forcing Hammer to escape but imprisoning his agents. |||| |||| While in jail, Bruno came up with new specifications for his melting ray with help from a fellow prisoner, a nuclear physicist who had been convicted for tax evasion. Designing it specifically for Iron Man’s latest armor, he spent no time tracking down Iron Man once released. Ironically, Iron Man was wearing an old suit of armor that remained unaffected by the Melter’s beam, and he was defeated once again. |||| |||| Having been defeated physically time and again left the Melter felling defeated more and more emotionally. He hoped to earn a more fearsome reputation by killing the Thing, who at the time was hospitalized after his battle with the Champion. However, nearly two dozen other villains hoped to also kill or capture the Thing, and they were kept at bay by dozens of heroes, each doing what they could to help their staunch friend recover in peace. |||| |||| Ever persistant in his obsession, the Melter returned to work on an yet more powerful version of his melting ray, but after completing it, he was shot by an assassin of the Scourge of the Underworld who was posing as the Melter’s assistant. ||||"

This suit heightens his senses, gives him the power of flight and the ability to travel in space without a vehicle.",,"A human archaeologist, Adam Strange wanders into a beam of light near an excavation site in South America.  Unbeknownst to him, this 'Zeta Beam' is of alien origin, and it immediately transports him to its source:  the planet Rann.  There, he promptly meets Alanna, the woman destined to be his wife, and her father, Sardath, the man that will provide the technological toys that turn him into the 'Defender of Rann'.  His trips to Rann are typically of limited duration, though, because the Zeta beam works by irradiating its passengers.  Once that radiation wears off, Strange finds himself back on Earth.  The beam comes to Earth at regular intervals, however, so he can, at least, know where and when to place himself so as to return to Rann.   Stories tend to stress his status as a 'man of two worlds', who spends the unfortunate bulk of his time on Earth--the one without his beloved Alanna. His most frequent ally has historically been the various Hawkpeople since the dawn of the Silver Age.  This perhaps unusual partnership has typically been explained by the fact that, on Earth, Hawkman and Adam Strange have practiced archeology when not superheroing.   Also, the Hawks and Adam Strange have forged a bond over the similarities of their lives as superheroes:  both are defending adopted planets. However, since 2004, DC has reworked things so as to display a relationship between the planets of Rann and Thanagar themselves--as the title Rann-Thanagar War suggests-- and it is currently uncertain what impact this inter-societal conflict will have on the interpersonal relationships of Hawkman/woman/girl and Adam Strange."

During “savage” periods (which unlike her cousin, are not brought on by anger or emotions of any kind, but rather outside forces, such as the manipulation of The Scarlet Witch during the Avengers Disassembled storyline or the manipulation of the gamma radiation which allows her to be She-Hulk in the first place), her strength levels drastically increase. She possesses an incredibly high level of durability, making her impervious to most injuries and disease, as well as making her resistant to extreme temperature variations. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor which allows her to rapidly heal and regenerate from most serious injuries she incurs (she was able to heal from a serious stomach wound inflicted by the Wendigo in a matter of minutes). Her immense strength allows her the ability to jump upwards of 600 feet high and about 1000 feet across. |||| |||| She-Hulk is apparently also able to swap physiques with other humans using Ovoid mind techniques. This ability however, was introduced during John Byrne’s infamous fourth-wall breaking run on Sensational She-Hulk, and has not been seen in use, or even mentioned, since. Whether She-Hulk actually possesses this ability is in question. |||| |||| She-Hulk is also skilled in a number of unspecified martial arts techniques after being trained by Gamora, and unlike earlier in her super-hero career where she preferred to simply use her strength to fight (even though she was a competent hand-to-hand combatant after being trained by Captain America), she now regularly employs these skills in battle. |||| |||| In addition to the powers and skills mentioned above, She-Hulk is also a highly skilled and competent lawyer.",,"Jennifer Walters, the meek and mousy lawyer cousin of Bruce Banner, was the daughter of Sheriff Morris Walters. Agents of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day when her cousin was in town. Bruce gave her a blood transfusion, as no other donors of her blood type were available; the radioactive blood mutated Jennifer as it had her cousin, transforming her into the She-Hulk. |||| |||| Although Jennifer was at first savage while in her form as She-Hulk, she eventually gained the same intelligence she had as the normal Jennifer Walters. She quickly came to appreciate the confidence and assertiveness that had come with being She-Hulk. For a long time, she felt more comfortable in her form as She-Hulk than in her 'normal' form as Jennifer. But she has gradually grown comfortable in both forms, and realized that she has much to offer the world in both her forms. After a brief solo career, she joined the Avengers and temporarily replaced the Thing in the Fantastic Four. |||| |||| During her tenure with the Fantastic Four, the She-Hulk had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. This radiation exposure apparently mutated Jennifer to the point that she could not transform back into her original form. But this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred her She-Hulk form anyway. It was revealed much later that the 'genetic block' was in fact purely psychological, shortly before a similar block locked her in non-Hulk form. That block proved to be temporary. |||| |||| After the Fantastic Four , the She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers and joined the staff of District Attorney Blake Tower, where she met Louise 'Weezi' Mason, formerly the Golden Age super heroine called the Blonde Phantom; during this period, she discovered that Mason had manipulated Towers into hiring She-Hulk so that Mason could again star in a comic book and thus avoid dying of old age. Mason's husband, also a former comic book character, had passed away three years ago, but other, more popular characters from the era, such as Captain America and Namor the Sub-Mariner, were still around. |||| |||| While doing some legal work for Heroes for Hire, she also went on a few adventures with them and spent some time dating Luke Cage. Later She-Hulk was a member of the short lived hero group the Fantastic Force. |||| |||| Jennifer currently works as a lawyer for the Superhuman Law division of the New York law firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, & Holliway.

Her gloves and boots are equipped with miniature suction cups which enable her to cling to surfaces. Her belt contains plastic explosives.",,"Natalia Romanova, known to most as Natasha Romanoff, is rumored to be a relative of the Romanoffs, the last ruling czars of Russia, but nothing else is known of her family. During World War II, a Nazi assault upon Stalingrad set the building she was in on fire. A woman, possibly her mother, threw her into the arms of a Russian soldier named Ivan Petrovich before being consumed by the flames. |||| |||| Ivan brought Natasha under his protection and soon had to defend her from her many enemies. In 1941, Natasha was sought by the Nazi Baron Strucker, who presented her to the Hand to become their master assassin. She was saved from Strucker and the Hand by Ivan, the American super-hero Captain America, and the Canadian adventurer Logan. |||| |||| Under Ivan's care, Natasha grew to pursue her goal of becoming a ballet dancer and studied under Oksana Bolishinko, a famous Bolshoi instructor. She fell in love with a Soviet test pilot named Alexi Shostakov but was grief-stricken when he apparently died testing an experimental rocket. Natasha decided that she would honor Alexi's memory by becoming an intelligence operative, not realizing that this was what the K.G.B. had hoped would happen when they informed her of Alexi’s death. She was instructed by the K.G.B. in their infamous Red Room Academy and under their training, she became their most skilled operative, a superb fighter and information-gatherer. The K.G.B. gave her the code name of 'Black Widow,' and quickly sent her into the field. |||| |||| When Logan resurfaced in America, now bereft of his memory, Natasha set out as the Black Widow to save him from a team of HYDRA assassins. She soon encountered Logan again when he, Ben Grimm, and Carol Danvers stole the Red Storm Project from Russia. Natasha pursued them but was ordered off by her superiors. |||| |||| The Black Widow's first encounter with Iron Man came when she was directed to slay Anton Vanko, the creator of the Soviet Crimson Dynamo armor, who had defected to America. Natasha attempted to distract Tony Stark while her partner Boris Turgenov used the Crimson Dynamo to destroy Stark's plants. Turgenov and Vanko wound up perishing in battle, and Natasha remained in America to find some way of regaining the K.G.B.'s favor. |||| |||| Since Tony Stark was still unaware that she was a K.G.B. operative, she continued to romance him so that she could steal a new anti-gravity device he had created. She managed to use the device to commit various acts of sabotage, even lifting entire buildings into the air, but Iron Man nullified the device and she barely escaped capture, now unable to trick Stark into lowering his guard. |||| |||| By luck, Natasha happened upon the new costumed crime fighter Hawkeye, who had been mistaken for a criminal by the police. Hawkeye was so taken with Natasha that she was able to entice him into an attempt at stealing plans from Tony Stark. Hawkeye fought Iron Man while Natasha watched from a distance, but when Iron Man deflected one of Hawkeye's explosive arrows, the force of the impact struck Natasha down, knocking her unconscious. Hawkeye fled the scene to help Natasha recover. |||| |||| After Natasha recovered, her superiors instructed her to avoid Stark Industries for a time and directed her instead to target Williams Innovations. She duped Hawkeye into assaulting that firm, but Spider-Man intervened and Hawkeye turned back as he had begun to suspect his lover's true motivations. Natasha later sent Hawkeye out on a second attempt to steal Stark's plans. However, while Hawkeye was gone, she was kidnapped by the K.G.B. and returned to Russia. The K.G.B. designed a new costume for her and equipped her with her 'widow's bite' and 'widow's line'. With these new weapons Natasha joined Hawkeye in battle against Iron Man in an attempt to destroy him, but when Iron Man shocked Natasha with an electrical blast Hawkeye disobeyed her orders to save her life once again. The K.G.B. then returned and stole Natasha away from Hawkeye. |||| |||| This time the K.G.B. brainwashed Natasha to ensure her loyalty to the state; in her next mission, she found herself allied against Hawkeye, who had become a member of the Avengers. Her love for Hawkeye allowed her to resist the brainwashing, and she finally turned against the K.G.B. She became an ally of the Avengers for awhile, aiding them against the Sons of the Serpent. She also proved instrumental in defeating the alien Ultroids who were certain the Avengers would not kill their leader Ixar because of their oath against killing, but Natasha forced Ixar to surrender, reasoning that as she was not an Avenger, she was not bound by their oaths. |||| |||| On an assignment for S.H.I.E.L.D., Natasha discovered that Alexi Shostakov was still alive, and had been transformed by the K.G.B. into the costumed hero, the Red Guardian. She and the Avengers opposed the Red Guardian and his masters, and Alexi died in the battle. For a while Natasha abandoned her identity as the Black Widow, just as the Avengers were about to make her an official member. |||| |||| Natasha finally decided to resume the Black Widow identity, but soon broke off her relationship with Hawkeye so that she could pursue a solo career. She adopted a new all-black uniform and became a vigilante, battling street gangs and organized crime in New York. Ivan had come to America by then, and he served as her chauffeur and confidant. Her new methods of operation brought her into contact with Daredevil, and she soon developed both a professional and personal relationship with him, while into battle side by side as they fell in love. |||| |||| Natasha was less taken with Matt's law partner Foggy Nelson, who was manipulated by the villain Mr. Kline into prosecuting her for the murder of the Scorpion (it was actually a robot of the Scorpion created by Mr. Kline). Although Natasha was proven innocent, she never truly forgave Foggy for the savagery of his courtroom assault. |||| |||| Matt broke up with his long-time love, Karen Page, so that he could be with Natasha, and the two of them moved to San Francisco to start a new life together. They fought against menaces such as Man-Bull, Blue Talon, Dark Messiah, Angar the Screamer, Ramrod, Terrex, Kraven the Hunter, Death-Stalker, Owl, el Jaguar, HYDRA, and Damon Dran, the Indestructible Man. |||| |||| Natasha wanted to find a new career for herself beyond the day-to-day adventures she and Daredevil enjoyed, and attempted to become a fashion designer, but her career never took off, and her relationship with Matt became strained. Natasha left Daredevil briefly to accept an offer of membership in the Avengers after aiding them against Magneto, but she soon left them after determining from a battle against the Lion God that she did not fit into a team environment. Natasha and Matt reconciled for awhile, but after a lengthy romance, Natasha finally broke up with Matt because she felt he did not treat her as an equal in battle. |||| |||| Still on the West Coast, Natasha joined forces with Ghost Rider (John Blaze) and Angel and Iceman of the X-Men when the gods Hercules and Venus were captured by the armies of Pluto and Ares. After having saved Hercules from a forced marriage, he joined the four heroes to found a new super-hero team, the Champions. Based in Los Angeles and bankrolled by the Angel, the team enjoyed modest success in their adventures. During this time, Natasha became involved with Hercules, but his perspective as an immortal made a long-term relationship seem unimportant. The Champions finally disbanded due to bankruptcy. |||| |||| Although she and Daredevil had parted ways, the Black Widow was still well-known to Daredevil's enemies as a woman he had loved, and Natasha was captured by Bullseye to be used as bait in an attempt to slay Daredevil. However, Natasha escaped her bonds and aided Daredevil in defeating Bullseye. |||| |||| Damon Dran, one of Natasha's enemies from her days with Daredevil, captured Ivan in order to lure Natasha to his island, where he set an army of female combat specialists against her. Dran intended to send an agent impersonating the Black Widow to infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and assassinate Nick Fury, but Natasha defeated his agents, warned Fury, and saved Ivan from Dran before S.H.I.E.L.D. bombed Dran's island. |||| |||| The Black Widow was once more embroiled in the schemes of the Hand when she attempted to prevent them from stealing the body of their master warrior, Kirigi, from the morgue. The Hand struck Natasha down with poisons that killed her, but Stone of the Chaste restored her to life. She joined forces with Daredevil and Stone against the Hand when they attempted to revive Elektra. Natasha guessed at the time that Elektra had been successfully revived, but kept this from Matt for his own good. |||| |||| When Natasha learned that Oksana Bolishinko, her old instructor, was in America at the Russian Embassy, she broke her way into the premises, seeking to apologize to her mentor for abandoning the ballet to become a spy. Oskana replied that Natasha was not the only pupil of hers who had been stolen away by the K.G.B., and that she accepted that espionage was Natasha's true calling. |||| |||| Russian agents then created a Life Model Decoy (LMD) of Alexi Shostakov, which they used to dupe Natasha into believing her husband was still alive. With threats of terminating Alexi, they coerced her into performing acts of espionage for Russia against the U.S. Upon gaining the desired technology, the Russians revealed the truth and tried to kill the Widow, but with the aid of Ivan, she defeated them and destroyed the LMD. |||| |||| Natasha later joined forces with Iron Man to prevent the Russian sleeper agent code named 'Oktober' from launching nuclear missiles which would have caused World War III. Unknown to Natasha, she herself was Oktober, and succeeded in launching the missiles. Fortunately, Iron Man prevented them from being detonated and aided Natasha in capturing the K.G.B. agent responsible for Natasha's reprogramming. The Widow also worked alongside Daredevil against the murdering telepath known as Rose, who had targeted other telepaths, including several members of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ESPer unit. |||| |||| Natasha eventually returned to the Avengers and assumed the mantle of leadership, usually managing the team's operations from Avengers Mansion while allowing the Black Knight to lead in the field. During this time she also became attracted to Captain America, but wound up sleeping with Tony Stark instead. Her tenure as the Avengers' leader came to a sorrowful end when most of the team was apparently slain battling Onslaught. Unable to rebuild the Avengers roster herself, and threatened with legal action from the Maria Stark Foundation, the Black Widow allowed the Avengers to dissolve. |||| |||| Considering herself to be the last Avenger, Natasha embarked upon a personal mission to bring down all of the Avengers' former enemies, including the Grey Gargoyle and Masters of Evil. She again encountered Daredevil at this time, who was concerned with her mental state as he witnessed her obsessive hunting of the Grey Gargoyle. Natasha's presence in Daredevil's life again complicated his relationship with Karen Page, which at that time was still being rebuilt. Although Natasha was willing to rekindle their relationship, she acknowledged that Karen was the woman Matt loved and nobly allowed them their space. Later on, she even offered to assist Karen after she had been framed for murder by Mr. Fear. |||| |||| Natasha was also the first person to correctly identify the former members of the Masters of Evil who had adopted the guise of the heroic Thunderbolts. She attempted to turn M.A.C.H.-1 and Songbird against Baron Zemo before he could make his move, inspiring them by telling them how Hawkeye, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch had redeemed their own criminal identities, but Zemo set his plan into motion before they could reach a decision. |||| |||| The Avengers finally returned and resumed their operations, but the Black Widow has only occasionally assisted them on missions, still feeling responsible for the team's disbanding. Instead, she has focused on her espionage work. Natasha has accepted several more assignments from S.H.I.E.L.D., such as impersonating the terrorist leader Ebon Flame in order to shut down her organization, Freedom's Light. She also had Iron Man assist her in infiltrating the forced-labor camp for scientists run by Tuatara under the Mandarin's direction. |||| |||| Natasha came close to learning some truths about her past when she was led into a trap by a man named Vindiktor, who claimed to have a copy of Natasha's mother's diary. This turned out to be false, but as Natasha fought him, he claimed that he was her brother. Unfortunately, Vindiktor died during their battle before Natasha could ascertain if he was telling the truth. |||| |||| Natasha crossed Daredevil's path again when he attempted to slay Baby Karen, believing the infant to be the Anti-Christ. Natasha saved the child, but was badly beaten by Daredevil in the ensuing fight. Karen Page ultimately died protecting the child, and Matt went to Natasha to be consoled and to explain his earlier actions to her. Natasha reconciled with Matt, revealing that she still loved him, but noted that they had grown too far apart to become a couple again. |||| |||| Recently, Natasha became aware of the presence of another Black Widow, a younger woman named Yelena Belova who had also been trained at the Red Room. Yelena was obsessed with being the sole Black Widow; the two Black Widows first encountered each other while attempting to retrieve the Endless Fury bio weapon created in Rhapistan, which exploded violently. Natasha later had herself and Yelena trade appearances through plastic surgery to help teach Yelena that her superiors considered her expendable. |||| |||| Despite the presence of the other Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff remains one of the world's most accomplished hand-to-hand combatants, and is quite possibly the most skilled espionage agent alive, still in high demand with S.H.I.E.L.D. Her most recent S.H.I.E.L.D. assignment has been to trace the whereabouts of the Tinkerer during a plot to investigate the financing of super-villains in America by foreign nations, possibly Latveria."

Part of the division of the Imperial Guard known as the Superguardians, Starbolt was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor D'ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. During the clash, Starbolt became enraged when he saw the feral X-Man Wolverine attacking his teammate and then-lover Oracle. After Starbolt flash-fried him, Wolverine quickly took the two lovers out of the fight by slamming them into each other. |||| |||| Starbolt was also one of eight Imperial Guardsmen chosen to battle the X-Men over the fate of Phoenix, a primal force of the cosmos that had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey. |||| |||| Soon after, Starbolt was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi'ar High Council member Lord Samédàr who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Samédàr, Starbolt remained steadfast in his loyalty to then-Empress Lilandra. |||| |||| Later, after the formerly-exiled Deathbird had usurped the Shi'ar throne, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who clashed with the British team of costumed adventurers known as Excalibur and the team of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers over the fate of the then-bearer of the cosmic Phoenix Force, the alternate future daughter of the X-Man Jean Grey named Rachel Summers. |||| |||| Much later, the intergalactic teleporter Lila Cheney transported the X-Men to the Shi'ar Empire at the behest of then-Empress Deathbird in time to see Lilandra regain her throne. Not all was as it seemed, however, as in reality a group of Warskrulls, using technology to allow them to duplicate superpowers, had captured and impersonated the X-Men's founder, the telepathic Professor Charles Xavier, using his telepathy to control Lilandra and the Imperial Guard, including Starbolt. After the ruse was discovered by the X-Men and all the Warskrull impostors were exposed, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore. |||| |||| During the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires, Starbolt was part of a small team of Guardsmen who were charged with preventing the member of the Earth team of super-powered beings known as the Avengers named Quasar from retrieving the legendary Nega-Bands of the Kree warrior Captain Mar-vell, which had been stolen. |||| |||| Subsequently, Starbolt was amongst those Imperial Guard members who defended Lilandra against an assassination attempt by the Kree Ronan the Accuser and his unwilling agents, the royal family of the Earth race known as the Inhumans."

Apprehended, he served his prison sentence and was paroled after three years for good behavior. |||| |||| In prison, Lang furthered his study of electronics and was soon hired by Stark International to work in its design department. When his daughter Cassie became seriously ill, Lang decided to return to burglary as a final resort. |||| |||| He broke into the home of Dr. Henry Pym and stole his Ant-Man uniform and shrinking gas canisters. Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross Technological Enterprises and discovered that Dr. Sondheim, the only person capable of helping his daughter, was being held prisoner. He rescued the doctor and was relieved when Sondheim was able to save the life of his beloved Cassie. |||| |||| Lang had intended to return the Ant-Man costume to Pym and turn himself in for its theft but Pym, aware of the use to which Lang had put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, provided he only use them to uphold the law. |||| |||| Shortly after, Lang donned the Ant-Man costume on various occasions to assist Iron Man and the Avengers, and briefly was hired by the Fantastic Four when Reed Richards was missing and presumed dead. |||| |||| After Lang's ex-wife gained custody of their daughter Cassie, Lang accepted an offer to join the Avengers officially. His personality clashed immediately with fellow Avenger Jack of Hearts. However, shortly before Jack committed suicide in The Avengers (3rd series) #76, Jack helped save Cassie from a child-murderer. |||| |||| Lang dated private investigator and former superhero Jessica Jones briefly, and Purple Man used his powers to make him appear dead to Jessica, but their relationship was broken off when he learned Jessica was pregnant with the child of Luke Cage, another superhero.

Only team leader, Mister Immortal, was able to hear her. In fact, the two had a romantic relationship which is probably one reason why she had a calming effect on him when he went into one of his uncontrollable rages. As all of the other Great Lakes Avengers, Dinah Soar had not been taken seriously by the rest of the superhuman community that were aware of her existence, but her aerial acrobatics were nothing to scoff at. She had fought side by side with her teammates against such foes as Deadpool, the Thunderbolts, and Graviton, but it was only during the battle against Maelstrom that her concern for her injured lover led her to be distracted long enough for Maelstrom to deliver a killing blow.

He is beloved across Asgard, by all creatures large and small. He's a natural warrior with skills that surpass even my own. |||| |||| Like the mythological version, the Marvel Balder is the catalyst that will trigger Ragnarok and end Asgard. This almost happened when Loki had the blind god Hoder accidentally kill Balder, but is averted by the planning of Odin, who later restores Balder to life. |||| |||| Balder once traveled alone in the land of the dead, seeing many horrifying things, including souls of some of the men he had personally killed. Returning to Asgard, he was a traumatized shell of his former self. His recovery was supervised by Volstagg, a member of the Warriors Three. |||| |||| Balder also has a love-hate relationship with Karnilla, the Queen of the Norns, who has aided both Loki and Asgard at times. Karnilla's lust for Balder inadvertently causes the death of Balder's current love, Nanna - an act that Balder has never forgotten. |||| |||| Balder would spend time as a loyal companion of Eric Masterson, who was wielding the power of Thor. In one incident, as Eric battles the murderous Blooddaxe, Balder runs interference, saving the lives of many nearby policemen. Soon after this battle, Balder and Eric willingly enter Mephisto's realm, to assist Sif. This was done despite both knowing Eric had lost his powers after the battle with Bloodaxe. |||| |||| With the exception of Thor, Volstag, Hogun, Fandral and Heimdal, Balder and all other Asgardians are currently dead, having died during the final Ragnarok. |||| |||| *** IN ASGARD *** |||| Balder remained in Asgard for many years and fought alongside Thor for many more battles. |||| |||| He even helped out Greyval Grimson returning the Raven Banner of Asgard, because Greyval's wife, valkirior Sygnet request he could talk with lord Odin. The banner was lost in the Battle of Ida Plain and Greyval is heir to be the bearer. |||| |||| He also helped out Thor's replacement Thunderstrike and later Red Norvell, a human whom took the role of defender of the earth when Thor was seemingly lost and killed in the battle against Onslaught. Thor eventually returned from his seeming death and returned to Asgard. Balder helped Thor deal with the loss of his father after he had been slain by Surtur . As of these events, Thor became the ruler of Asgard. A difficult task in witch Balder helped him to make the dessicions that he stood for as a king. Eventually Thor brought Asgard to Earth, hoping to inspire the people living there. While Balder was not sure of this dessicion, he supported Thor anyway. Eventually, the kingdom returned to it's former place, leaving Earth once again."

The Black Widow is a master martial artist, an expert markswoman, a natural actress, an infamous seductress, and a gifted veteran spy. She carries assorted firearms and various miniaturized tools and weapons, such as communications equipment, tear gas pellets, various drugs, an electrostatic discharge weapon, spring-loaded cables and surveillance devices; her costuming has also included microscopic suction cups enabling her to cling to walls and ceilings.

She became a mainstay of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s black ops division, often partnered with Hawkeye (Clint Barton). |||| |||| After Hawkeye and the Widow led the successful extermination of over five hundred Chitauri extraterrestrial subversives, the duo was promoted to the ranks of the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s celebrity super-agents, with newly falsified personal backgrounds. Alongside the Ultimates, Black Widow helped save Earth from a Chitauri plot. She and teammate Iron Man (wealthy playboy genius Tony Stark) became lovers during the struggle, and later began dating seriously, despite Natasha's mutually hostile relationship with Stark's caustic butler, Edwin Jarvis. |||| |||| Giving Natasha the female equivalent of his Iron Man battle armor, Stark asked her to marry him and she said yes; however, the bloody massacre of Clint Barton's entire family by a secret traitor within the Ultimates cast a pall over Tony and Natalia's wedding preparations."

He developed a talent and passion for baseball, quickly becoming a top-notch pitcher and moving from a minor league position to one in the majors. Many sports writers agreed that Myers could have been one of the world’s greatest pitchers, but within a year, he was suspended for taking bribes. |||| |||| He found employment (and fulfillment) as an assassin for the subversive society known as the Secret Empire, who gave him the equipment and identity of Boomerang. One of his first known exploits on behalf of the Empire occurred when the Empire was investigating the U.S. Army’s Orion missile program, one that was being used against the Hulk. Boomerang kidnapped the General’s daughter, Betty Ross, in order to ask for the missile plans in ransom. Instead, he was defeated by the Hulk. |||| |||| Upon the collapse of the Secret Empire, Myers returned to Australia briefly but eventually was hired by the criminal financier Justin Hammer who offered him new equipment and employment.

Though based on selective gene breeding, the true source of her powers are not known, leading many fans to believe she just has the right blend of psionic powers, strength, fighting skills, and alien tactical knowledge to have Superman's number.","Maxima is hot-headed and tends to make snap-judgments without considering the consequences of her actions.  A perfect example of this can be seen when she tears down a light pole in the middle of a gasoline-soaked conflict with Doomsday, causing an enormous explosion that knocks herself and Superman unconscious.","Oldest child of the Royal family of the planet Almerac, the fiery-tempered Maxima came to Earth in search of a suitable mate, leaving behind Ultraa her betrothed. She and Superman are genetically compatible; she could give him what no Earth woman could - children. She was infuriated when Superman rejected her offer, saying he had no desire to father despots (Action Comics #652). |||| |||| Maxima later found herself reluctantly working with Brainiac who had destroyed Almerac with the WarWorld. She turned against him, and helped Earth's heroes defeat him, subsequently joining a reformed Justice League for her own reasons after the League saved Almerac from Starbreaker. As a Leaguer, she helped in the fight against Doomsday, and when that version of the League disbanded, she became a member of Captain Atom's Extreme Justice. She considered both Captain Atom and Amazing Man as potential mates, but neither were interested. During the period of her flirtation with Captain Atom, an angry jilted Ultraa attacked him, Maxima eventually stopped the brawl and sent Ultraa back to Almerac. |||| |||| She offered herself to Superman again, hoping that her recent good deeds would offset her earlier ruthlessness. (Superman: The Wedding Album, Man of Tomorrow #7) Superman, now married to Lois Lane, was even less interested in her proposal than before. Angry and humiliated, she joined the Superman Revenge Squad. She swore that Superman had rejected, humbled and humiliated her for the last time, and threatened that the next they met, it would truly be war (Man of Tomorrow #10). |||| |||| However, in her next appearance, during the build up to the Our Worlds At War crossover, Maxima and the 'Chosen People of Almerac', as she phrased it, showed up in Earth's solar system where they met up with Superman and fellow JLA member, Green Lantern. Superman and Green Lantern were just beginning to investigate the disturbing disappearance of Pluto and the even more distressing engine ion trail associated with Warworld, when they stumbled across Maxima, her people, and the super-villain Massacre. |||| |||| After a battle full of wounded pride, Maxima eventually conceded her position when Almerac's rendezvous showed up using a Boom Tube. She explained that she was leading her people to safety from Imperiex, the force that conquered her world. Massacre had seemed to meet his death back in Superman #106, however somehow Maxima came across him and described her association in these words, 'Massacre serves only me now'. To save her people she allied herself with Darkseid's son, Grayven, who was taking them to regions unknown. This was also being undertaken without the knowledge of Darkseid. Maxima left Superman with these words: 'Mark my words, when Imperiex comes for your precious home world, you'll see alliances you've never dreamed of.' |||| |||| All that Maxima warned eventually came to fruition as she and a myriad of other characters (both heroes and villains) formed alliances with Earth and Apokolips in an effort to destroy Imperiex (Man of Steel # 115). |||| |||| Maxima ultimately met her demise in an heroic effort to put her ship between the destructive beams of Brainiac 13's Warworld which would have resulted in the destruction of the entire universe (Man of Steel #117).

He grew up to become a scientist as a result of this childhood-- one where he often felt life was never under his control. However, his unorthodox practices and theories, all about harnessing the power of the human mind, only served to bar him from working with any legitimate research center. Instead, his brother Vincent managed to use his influence as a lawyer for Cord Industries to get Basil a job there. Vincent, himself less than scrupulous, hoped Basil would help him take over the company, but when Basil went on a rampage in the lab, Vincent accidentally pushed him into some experimental chemicals. The resultant explosion scarred and crippled Basil, leaving him once more bed-ridden and weak. |||| |||| Out of guilt, Vincent set his brother up in an automated house and laboratory using money embezzled from Cord Industries. Basil eventually used the equipment to fashion a exoskeleton that would finally allow himself freedom of movement and control over his own destiny. In fact, he became determined to control the world. Using a Mental-Wave Absorbatron, Basil could tap into the mental energy of his victims and beam it to his exoskeleton, and the “slave discs” would help by remotely adding to the Absorbatron’s range of broadcast. In this manner, Basil, now calling himself the Controller, took over his entire town, starting with Vincent, who dared to confront his brother. |||| |||| Tony Stark and Janice Cord happened to investigate Cord Industries and Basil took the opportunity to battle Iron Man, who he saw as a product of Stark’s “inferior” genius. Although the Controller seemed to have the upper hand, Iron Man was able to lead him out of range of the Absorbatron and defeat him. |||| |||| While in prison, Basil found that the mental energies he had previously absorbed left him with enough power to take control over others’ minds. Thus, he arranged for his own transfer to a sanitarium and systematically took control over the staff and patients. After using his pawns to create a new Absorbatron for him, he also wanted to upgrade his helmet to avoid his previous defeat. He lured Tony Stark to the santitarium, forcing him to invent a helmet that no longer would allow him to travel out of range but could also fire destructive bolts of mental energy. Tony Stark battled the Controller as Iron Man until the circutis in the Controller’s helmet fried, a design Stark intentionally put in to foil the Controller. |||| |||| Later, somehow he was contacted by Thanos, who provided Sandhurst with alien technology to update and enhance his equipment. Now, Basil no longer needed the Absorbatron as he could absorb his victims’ mental energies directly from their slave discs. He was defeated, however, by Captain Marvel. |||| |||| Sandhurst continued to enslave others by moving to southern California and setting himself up as a New Age guru and attaching slave discs to visitors to his temple. At the time, Iron Man was seeking out any illegeal use of technology stole from Stark Industries, which included the Controller, and Iron Man defeated him, destroying the Controller’s technology and leaving him wholly dependant on his life-support machines. |||| |||| Even still, the Controller continued his criminal activities. The Red Skull partnered with him to manipulate the Sub-Mariner into fighting Captain America, but the Captain destroyed the slave disc that was controlling his friend and the two turned the tables on him. Briefly, the Controller set up a self-help clinic. By placing his “patients” in a device similar to a tanning salon booth, he would profess to cure their minds. In fact, he created the booths to mimic his slave disc technology. Thus, he would “cure” his victims, but not before using his powers to extort money for himself and boost the strength of his armor. He was again defeated by Iron Man who, as Tony Stark, tried to visit the clinic. |||| |||| Another time, the Controller managed to place Sarah Jessup, a powerful psychic, under his control, feeding him more power than ever before and allowing him to control others without the need of his slave discs. He sought out Tony Stark for revenge, but as the two battled, they released a being called Mindstorm, a psychic entity that manifested from Sarah Jessup’s mind. They both had to contend with Mindstorm that resulted in the two enemies sharing each other’s minds for a brief time. Stark was able to destroy the Controller’s machines, but the process left Sarah dead and Basil in a vegetative state with only his machines keeping him alive. |||| |||| The Controller next appeared hoping to capture the alien Legacy (Genis-Vell). He placed Captain Marvel (Monica Rambeau) under his control and sent her to fight Genis. The two were able to combine forces to defeat the Controller. As it happened, the Controller was trying to capture Genis as a test of his technology on behalf of the Master of the World, who had revived him from his coma and appropriated his technology for himself. |||| |||| The Master gave his other agents, the U-Foes, a slave disc to attach to the Hulk. With the Hulk under their control, the U-Foes attacked the United Nations in order to use other discs to drain the knowledge of the scientsits that were assembled there. The U-Foes were opposed by Iron Fist and a new Heroes for Hire team, and they managed to free the Hulk and force the U-Foes to escape, but not before they had got what they came for. The Master then ordered the Controller and the U-Foes to attack the Heroes for Hire, and when the Controller seemed about to be defeated, the U-Foes prepared to teleport away, leaving the Controller to take the fall for the Master’s plan. Instead, the Master double-crossed the villains, and the U-Foes were captured as well. |||| |||| With the Master’s abandonment, the Controller was free to pursue his own agenda. He used his mental dominion to once again escape prison, setting himself up as a doctor, Alexander Basel, of a stress-management clinic. He managed to draw in high-profile clients, including businessmen and senators, and he would use his mind-control technology on them while they slept. Tony Stark attended the clinic, and the Controller saw an opportunity for revenge. He ordered Stark to fire Iron Man, not knowing that the two were one and the same. The conflict Stark felt led him to uncover the Controller’s influence, and he defeated the Controller as Iron Man. |||| |||| More recently, the Controller was among those villains incarcerated in the Raft and escaped during a massive breakout. He tried to set himself up as a crime boss in New York City, competing with many other villains, but he was ultimately captured by the new Avengers."

The resulting explosion transformed Faulkner into a huge, incredibly strong orange-skinned amazon, and nearly killed Moyers and Lane. |||| |||| Kitty had gained the ability to absorb solar energy through her skin, which made her grow continually taller and stronger. Disoriented and confused, she began to run amok through the streets of Metropolis. The Daily Planet, not knowing she was actually Kitty Faulkner, quickly dubbed her 'Rampage'. Superman stepped in, but showed restraint in subduing her, mistakenly thinking she was Lois Lane. After Rampage was revealed to be Dr. Faulkner, Superman was able to drain off her excess solar energy and return Kitty to normal. |||| |||| Months later Dr. Faulkner fell ill, finding that her body now needed exposure to a certain amount of solar and cosmic energy or she would die. Dr. Moyers gave her a technological device in the form of a collar that would maintain the proper amount of exposure to keep her alive. But Moyers also had a sinister motive, he transformed Faulkner into Rampage and had her sabotage the presidential campaign of Herbert Forrest. Forrest and Moyers were former friends, but Moyers had come to resent the candidate's corrupt morality. After several attacks Superman helped free Rampage from Moyers' control and sent him to jail. After modifying the regulator control collar, Kitty had her powers under control, and accepted a job at S.T.A.R. Labs. |||| |||| Faulkner proved to be a talented administrator and earned a transfer to new S.T.A.R. Labs in Phoenix Arizona. Once there she befriended the young superhero Starman (Will Payton). She helped him on several occasions as Rampage, and the two formed a relationship. Her part-time career of heroics and her romance came to an end when she was sent back to Metropolis to take part in the major reorganization of S.T.A.R. Labs necessitated by the destruction of the corporations' main laboratory. |||| |||| Since her return to Metropolis, it has been hinted that Kitty may have developed a crush on the Parasite (Rudy Jones) before his death."

They later have a very personal moment when both students are called to talk about The Green Goblin's attack on the school. Otherwise, there is no instance of any relationship between Peter and Liz. Liz had an uncle who was a mutant, and this led to his death, though what exactly happened has not been explained. (The Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe suggested that her uncle may have been killed in Magneto's attacks during Ultimate X-Men, but Bendis has never commented on it.) As a result of this, Liz has a phobia of mutants and super-powered beings, and it has been suggested by other characters that she worries that she herself is a mutant.

Liz's best friend, Mary Jane, has also told Liz to keep her mutant phobia to herself when she's around MJ, and that she'd prefer it if Liz kept those thoughts to herself in general. |||| |||| Later it was revealed Liz herself is a mutant with flame powers, and also the secret love child of mutant villain the Blob.

Eventually he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer them, and to rule the planet as a dictator. |||| |||| When Hal Jordan joined the Corps, Sinestro was assigned to be his instructor. Jordan was horrified at the way Sinestro ruled his people like a dictator, though Sinestro maintained that his iron-fisted rule was necessary to protect his people from alien forces. As such, while repelling the alien warlords known as the Khunds from attacking the planet, the Korugarians rebelled. When Jordan called for help from the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro's dictatorship was exposed and he was forced before the Guardians for punishment. Sinestro's Green Lantern Ring was given to Katma Tui, the leader of the rebellion who had felt that Sinestro's 'protection' kept his people from growing as a society through contact with other alien races. |||| |||| Punishment and villainy |||| |||| The Guardians decided to punish Sinestro by banishing him to the 'anti-matter universe', in particular, the alien world of Qward. Their motive for doing so was to humble Sinestro, by exiling him to a world ruled by evil and in particular, beings who hated the Guardians and the Green Lanterns. This would be a major miscalculation, as Sinestro instead was taken in by the Weaponers of Qward. The Weaponers were a group of warrior and scientists who hated the Guardians as much as Sinestro did and the two became allies, with the Weaponers offering to help Sinestro gain revenge on the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians. |||| |||| Creating a yellow power ring for him to use, they sent him back to his home universe to seek his revenge. Sinestro quickly became a powerful nemesis toward the Green Lantern Corps, partially due to the fact that their power rings cannot directly affect anything yellow. Despite this, skilled Green Lanterns like Jordan always found ways to defeat him. |||| |||| Before the Guardians took a leave of absence from their universe to attempt mating with their counterparts the Zamarons, they constructed an inescapable prison for Sinestro and thousands of others on Oa. However, Sinestro's cunning prevailed once again and he managed to free himself through the mental manipulation of the Mad God of Sector 3600. Now wielding nearly unlimited power, Sinestro murdered entire star systems until he was finally subdued by the Green Lantern Corps of Earth. Now guilty of multiple acts of genocide, Sinestro was put on trial again by the assembled membership of the Green Lantern Corps. Finding him guilty, they condemned him to death and executed him, not realizing this activated a failsafe system within the Central Power Battery on Oa that caused it to be destroyed should ever a Korugarian male be killed by a Guardian or their agents (the failsafe was created by the Guardians after their mates, the Zamarons left them to live with Korugarians, a fact that they told no one out of jealousy and shame). Ironically, Sinestro's death then resulted (temporarily at least) in what he sought to achieve in life; the destruction of the Corps. He had also managed to cheat death itself by transferring his consciousness into the Central Power Battery, where he made a startling discovery about the ancient Yellow Impurity within the Green Lantern's light. |||| |||| The yellow impurity turned out to be a sentient entity known as Parallax and the two merged as Hal Jordan entered the battery to desperately try and save the few remaining Green Lanterns, whose power rings had not been rendered powerless by the death of Sinestro. Jordan ultimately defeated Sinestro, whose spirit was condemned to remain trapped inside the power battery for eternity. But for Sinestro, his was a victory that was greater: not only had he decimated the Green Lantern Corps, but through him, the yellow impurity entity Parallax had successfully infected Hal's mind, setting up Sinestro's ultimate triumph. |||| |||| Guy Gardner |||| |||| Guy Gardner, forced to forfeit his Green Lantern ring after a grudge match with Jordan, set out on a quest to regain his power and identity. With the help of Lobo, Gardner acquired the yellow power ring of Sinestro from Oa's Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge but actually needed to be used against Green Lanterns to restore power. Gardner found this out by accident when a member of the GLC fought him while he had absolutely no power. |||| |||| As the yellow ring spoke Sinestro's native language, Guy was unable to communicate with it, although it seemed to understand him to a degree. |||| |||| Guy only wore the yellow ring for a short while as the character was caught up in the new editorial direction for the Green Lantern franchise that led to the controversial Emerald Twilight storyline in Green Lantern (vol. 3) #48-50 and it was decided to take the yellow ring from Gardner and completely reinvent the character. |||| |||| Ultimate Revenge |||| |||| In the meantime, the return of the Guardians resulted in the Corps being re-established, only to be attacked and annihilated by Jordan himself when he was possessed by the Parallax entity, and taking it's name. Driven mad with grief by the destruction of his home city and the apathy of the Guardians towards his plight, the yellow impurity pushed Hal towards a Parallax-induced homicidal rampage that left scores of Green Lanterns dead or maimed as Parallax sought to absorb the Central Power Battery's energies into his being. |||| |||| Sinestro was then revived by the Guardians and sent to stop Hal only to be murdered by his enemy. But Sinestro's death was not as it appeared, as he would later imply that the being that Jordan killed was a construct made by Parallax and unknowingly extracted from the Central Power Battery. |||| |||| Hal Jordan promptly finished off the Green Lantern Corps by absorbing the Central Power Battery's energies into himself. How Sinestro escaped remains unknown, but he survived and went into hiding as he watched Hal become what Sinestro had become: a traitor and a murderer reviled by his friends and his allies. |||| |||| Return |||| |||| Sinestro eventually revealed the charade when Kyle Rayner discovered the existence of Parallax and revealed it to Green Arrow and the Justice League. Nearly killing the two heroes, Sinestro was stopped by the newly resurrected Hal Jordan, who reclaimed his ring and was purged of Parallax's influence. The two fought to a draw, with Sinestro escaping to the anti-matter universe when his ring was damaged by Hal during the fight. |||| |||| Sinestro later appeared in the miniseries Villains United, where he captured Lady Quark for the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Sinestro had been a member of the group in the past and played a major role in the Society's massacre of the Freedom Fighters, with Sinestro murdering the second Black Condor early on. |||| |||| Sinestro also has engaged in other sinister schemes: with the Green Lantern Corps restarted with the return of Hal Jordan, Sinestro has decided to found his own Corps, offering yellow power rings, and a role in the Sinestro Corps, to the most feared and savage warriors of the universe. The size and scope of this new organization has yet to be revealed but stands to be a major threat for the Green Lantern Corps in the near future. |||| |||| In a recent interview with Geoff Johns, writer of the current Green Lantern series, [1] it was revealed that the Sinestro Corps are actually meant to mirror the GLC, to the minutest of details. Johns said, 'The Sinestro Corps [will have] its own Oa-type planet, its own Guardians, [and] its own oath.' |||| |||| Sinestro Corps |||| |||| Enslaving all the Qwardian Weaponeers, surveilled by Arkillo, a large and muscular vicious alien with the same role of Drill Sergeant held by Kilowog in the GLC, he forced them to continuously build new yellow rings, programmed to breach the barrier between anti-matter and matter universe, find and recruit new warriors. |||| |||| All Qwardians now sport slave collars, put on them by Sinestro himself to assure their loyalty, and the planet has now a huge yellow 'Central Battery', like the Oan one. |||| |||| Known members, other than the Corps namesake and Arkillo, include: Karu-sil, 'the girl next door' from a planet populated by murders and sociopaths; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away while living off of the fungus growing on his 'hermit crab' like shell. [1] |||| |||| Recently, the Sinestro Corps tried to recruit Batman, known for being able to instill fear into the hearts of man. Batman rejected the ring however, due to Batman's own willpower and his former exposure to a Green Lantern Corps ring. The ring, seeking a 'replacement' was sent to Amon Sur, the disgruntled son of Abin Sur, who was attempting to steal Hal Jordan's ring at the same moment"
1216,Blackfire,Komand'r ,1216_20070704171518_char.jpg,"Because of a Psion experiment, Komand'r's body is a massive solar battery capable of storing tremendous amounts of energy and then releasing it as destructive starbolts. Komand'r is also a highly trained warrior possessing a variety of combat skills.",,"Komand'r was born the eldest child of Tamaran's royal family. The first princess born in over a hundred years, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born the Citadel Empire attacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr and killed three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened Komand'r was for all time inextricably linked with the terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r was crippled by a childhood illness that left her unable to absorb ultraviolet radiation to fly as most Tamaraneans did. |||| |||| Because of Komand'r's naturally grim disposition, a stark contrast to the royal family's generally contented outlook, the subjects of Tamaran hated her. As a result, though first in the line of succession, she was denied her birthright to be the next Princess of Tamaran to maintain respect and prestige of the royal family. Her privileges, honors, and her royal style and dignity were transferred to her younger sister, Princess Koriand'r (who would later become known as Starfire). Inwardly, Komand'r's rage grew and her resentment turned to hatred for her planet, her people, her family, and lastly her younger sister who, in Komand'r's eyes, made the fateful mistake of being born. |||| |||| Komand'r's rivalry continued and intensified when she and her siblings were sent, per Tamaran's warlike custom, for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Komand'r's true feeling were exposed, when during a sparring exercise she attempted to kill her sister, the Princess Koriand'r. As a result, she was expelled by the Warlords. Humiliated by her own transgression Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to become a warrior fighting against the forces of her own planet and, ultimately, her own family. |||| |||| Betrayal |||| |||| Komand'r later betrayed her planet with detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. |||| |||| Komand'r was her sister's master and made the most of her younger sister's bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When Kory killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but not before the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions. |||| |||| Psions, largely a species of sadistic scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranian bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, Komand'r's forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her and while the Psions were distracted, Kory broke free with the starbolts, destructive blasts of solar energy, which were a result of the experimentation. Against her better judgment she decided to free Komand'r, who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same (but more intensified), power and had her restrained for later execution. Kory escaped and stole a space ship to planet Earth, where she met a young group of heroes and helped form the new Teen Titans. |||| |||| Infinite Crisis and aftermath |||| |||| Komand'r recently appeared in the Rann-Thanagar War limited series, during which she killed Hawkwoman in her pursuit of a New Tamaran. She formed an uneasy alliance with the surviving players of the War, in order to deal with more pressing concerns (Infinite Crisis). She was not seen during the Crisis itself, and has recently appeared in Hawkgirl and JSA Classified, attempting to kill Hawkman and Hawkgirl. The Hawks defeated Komand'r, after which Hawkman used Psion technology to strip the villain of her starbolt powers."

406,Speedball (Marvel)(01 - Robbie Baldwin),Robert Baldwin ,406_20070101171449_char.jpg,"Robbie Baldwin's exposure to energy from a dimension of kinetic energy gave him the superhuman ability to create a kinetic field of unknown energy around himself which absorbs all kinetic energy directed against him (what he originally called the 'Speedball Effect.') This absorption can vary from resisting the effects of physical objects such as bricks and rocks to resisting that of energy and fire and even explosions. Within his kinetic field it is nearly impossible for him to be hurt, and he instead bounces harmlessly from object to object, with no loss or transference of momentum. |||| When transformed into Speedball, he is covered with a blue-and-gold costume (originally a facsimile of the lab uniform he wore when exposed to the energy) and surrounded by a display of multi-colored bubbles. At first, Robbie would transform uncontrollably if hit with a slight force, but eventually became able to activate the effect consciously. He typically uses the field to slam into his opponents, and the multi-colored light display can be used to distract opponents. After many years, Robbie has learned to extend the kinetic field outward, pushing back everything in his immediate area or, by focusing more locally, delivering more powerful blows in hand-to-hand combat.",,"Robbie Baldwin is the son of Justin Baldwin, District Attorney of Springdale, Connecticut, and Maddy Naylor-Baldwin, a popular actress. His parents held very opposite views and often argued in front of Robbie, a fact made more poignant as their arguments often had to do with what Robbie should be doing with his life and future career. |||| |||| As a high school student, Robbie was interning at the Hammond Research Laboratory in Connecticut. There, Doctor Benson and two colleagues began the final stages of their attempts to tap an extra-dimensional energy source, but the researchers did not construct adequate safeguards and the energies began to overload Hammond Labs' equipment. Part of the energies fed back into the generator, shorting out the entire system. Unfortunately, Robbie had sneaked into the lab where the experiment was taking place, curious as to what all the hush-hush preparations had been for. Robbie was bombarded by energy from the dimension but survived, finding himself surrounded by weird energy bubbles, clad in an odd costume, and having a hollow and resonant voice. Panicking, Robbie sought to escape to the roof of the lab building where he encountered four masked gunmen. During the ensuing battle, Robbie discovered that his body now generated a kinetic energy field that protected him from any impact and made him a bouncing dynamo of kinetic energy. |||| |||| Shortly afterward, Robbie's parents were accosted by Johnny Roarke, a criminal Justin Baldwin had put away, and Robbie used his powers to defeat him. The media leaped to the story, reporting the appearance of a new hero, whom they dubbed 'the Masked Marvel.' Robbie continued to use his powers to fight crime, and the Masked Marvel enjoyed a great deal of popularity from the townspeople, although his parents held very diametrical and vocal views about the costumed vigilante. Baldwin was forced to keep his power under control, avoiding any potential contact that might trigger his powers. He also spent much of his time trying capture Dr. Benson's cat, Niels, who was similarly caught in the energy experiment and gained Speedball-like powers, and using him to help understand his powers. |||| |||| During a trip to New York City, Robbie ended up helping Spider-Man and Daredevil stop the Purifiers of the High Evolutionary, but mostly Robbie fought criminals in Springdale, such as the Sticker, Leaper Logan, the Bug-Eyed Voice, and the Feathered Felon. Robbie hoped to become a big-time superhero, and even joined a tryout for the premier hero team Avengers, only to be rejected. During a shopping trip to New York City with his mother he saw a battle breaking out involving Terrax, former herald of Galactus. Joining the fray along with the other heroes that would subsequently become the founding members of the New Warriors, Robbie agreed to join the team as well after Terrax was defeated. |||| |||| Despite the long distance he often had to travel, Robbie stayed with the New Warriors for a long tenure, quickly becoming an annoying but loveable kid brother to the older Warriors and continuing to grow in the development of his powers. Shortly after joining the team, he asked his teammates to assist him in investigating the long absence of his mother, who had joined a fanatical ecological watchdog group, Project: Earth. The Warriors discovered the group wanted to kill Baldwin's mother, as her celebrity would serve to make her a martyr to their cause. Robbie helped save his mother and defeat Project: Earth, and in so doing he revealed his secret identity to her. Although shaken, she supported her son's lifestyle as a superhero. |||| |||| Speedball had battled numerous villains with the New Warriors, including Terrax, the Sphinx, the Puppet Master, Gideon, Force of Nature, Psionex, and the Folding Circle. At one point, the cosmic villain Magus created evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, and Robbie's duplicate used its powers to virtually destroy the town of Springdale. It also confronted Robbie's parents, and Robbie was forced to kill his duplicate. This led to his father discovering his secret identity, and Justin Baldwin denounced his son because of what he saw as vigilantism. |||| |||| Robbie’s parents got divorced, and Robbie chose to live with his mom in New York. This allowed him to develop deeper relationships with his teammates, notably Nova, Rage, and, perhaps more reluctantly, his neighbor Carlton LaFroyge (who used the knowledge of Robbie’s identity to force his way onto the team as Hindsight Lad.) |||| |||| When Timeslip joined the Warriors, telling of her visions of Speedball’s death, she and Robbie nevertheless developed the beginnings of a romantic friendship while seeking the truth behind these visions. At the same time, despite Speedball’s ever-increasing control over his powers, Robbie began experiencing severe spikes in his power levels that wreaked havoc over his immediate area. The Warriors were confronted by the Sphinx, who claimed the presence of Speedball was creating chaos with time itself. They were also confronted with the evil techno-organic being Advent. The Sphinx succeeded in killing Speedball before escaping, and Advent left for the future. Timeslip, holding Speedball when he died, received memories from him in his dying moments-- memories of a citizen from the future named Darrion Grobe. Grobe, the son of the man who would become Advent, hoped to undo the meddling his father had caused by traveling through the kinetic dimension to the past. He used futuristic technology to become a duplicate Robbie Baldwin/Speedball, replacing Speedball when he was trapped in the kinetic dimension by the Sphinx several months before. Timeslip used her knowledge and powers to transport the New Warriors to the future. There, a holographic persona of Darrion helped the Warriors to undo all of Advent's manipulations. Ultimately, the team had to enter the kinetic dimension to escape the future before it became re-made, and they brought back the true Speedball while returning home. |||| |||| Robbie has always been a New Warrior at heart. Even when the team seemed to be on a long hiatus, he and Nova helped re-form the Warriors to defeat Blastaar, adding new members Aegis and Bolt. Robbie and Nova even tried to pitch the New Warriors as an animated series, but they were forced to flee when they saw the producers’ unique take on the team. Nevertheless, Speedball returned when the New Warriors were led by Night Thrasher into a unique re-branding as a reality-TV show. Robbie’s bouncy personality seemed a perfect fit despite the contentions of other teammates, and the team hit the road to become heroes for the common man throughout small-town America. Eventually the New Warriors encountered Nitro, Speedfreek, Cobalt Man, and Coldheart and during the battle that followed Nitro used his power and caused a massive explosion killing the New Warriors and almost everyone around that area for an unknown distance. Speedball was seemingly killed during this explosion and was later ridiculed by TV talk show hosts."

Her mother died when giving birth and Luchino wanted his daughter to lead a respectable life, so he gave the child to Byron Frost and his wife Loretta to be raised. Byron Frost was a wealthy financier and an employee of Nefaria. He called the child Whitney and raised her as his own. |||| As a young adult, Whitney became engaged to politician Roger Vane. The Frosts died and Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage. He told Whitney that he wanted her to take his place as leader of the Maggia, a Mafia-like organisation on the East Coast of the United States. Whitney at first refused, but when she told Roger about her father, he left her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political career. |||| Whitney accepted her father's offer and was trained by him in strategy, criminal activities and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father was imprisoned, she became the new Big M, the leader of the Nefaria Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with Iron Man and after a raid on his company, Stark Industries, Whitney was forced to flee. Her plane crashed though and Whitney's face was scarred during the accident. She was saved by the criminal Mordecai Midas and started to work for him. Midas was obsessed with gold and Whitney hid her face behind a golden mask and used the alias 'Madame Masque'. |||| Madame Masque met Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter-ego and he showed concern for her, despite her scarred face. She turned on Midas to save Stark, but left Stark because of her criminal past. Unable to forget him, she returned as Krissy Longfellow, Stark's personal secretary. Both came to know of each other's secret identity and started a romantic relationship. Their happiness was short-lived though; her father was dying as the result of an attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hired the Ani-Men to bring her father to her and then asked Stark to find a cure for him. Nefaria tried to use violence to force Stark and a battle started between the Ani-Men and Iron Man. During the battle Whitney was unable to chose between her father and her lover and when Nefaria's life support was damaged in the fight, she went insane with guilt and grief. |||| Whitney returned to the Nefaria Maggia and as 'The Director' became its leader. She often fought Iron Man and his friends. At one point, Whitney became paranoid and started to create copies of herself, known as bio-duplicates. One of her bio-duplicates, known as Masque, was an ally of the Avengers. Whitney later ordered Masque exterminated for its aberrant behaviour."

She is also in superior physical condition due to her Inhuman physiology, though she is abnormally vulnerable to pollutants.",,"Crystal was born into the royal family of the Inhumans, a hidden race preoccupied with genetics. The Inhumans developed the Terrigan Mists, a mutagenic compound routinely applied to Inhuman children, as with Crystal, who was exposed in infancy. |||| |||| When Crystal's sister Medusa disappeared, Crystal and other Inhuman royalty searched the globe for her, ultimately finding her and returning to Attilan with the aid of the Fantastic Four. Along the way, a passionate romance blossomed between Crystal and the Human Torch. Though they were at first kept apart by her Inhuman family, and later a Negative Zone barrier that Maximus created around Attilan. But after Black Bolt used his powerful voice to destroy the barrier, the Inhuman's Council of Elders soon made the decision to split up the royal family while the city was being rebuilt. Then Crystal and her cousins left their sanctuary, with Black Bolt's agreement. Crystal was finally free to pursue Johnny, and with Black Bolt's approval, she rejoined him. Together with the Fantastic Four, she helped fight the newly escaped Blastaar, and continued to assist them, though she was usually restrained from active participation by an overly concerned Johnny Storm. Eventually, when the Invisible Girl gave birth to her first child, Crystal made herself a Fantastic Four uniform and announced that she would be her replacement. Skeptical, Mister Fantastic agreed to think about it, but after stopping the newest series of attacks from the criminal, Wizard, Crystal earned her place on the Marvel Universe's first family. Crystal was later captured by Maximus, using a controlled Lockjaw, after he had retaken the Inhuman throne. But Black Bolt once again used his destructive voice to free them and send Maximus scurrying to a hidden rocket. Crystal first had to leave the Fantastic Four when Black Bolt injured himself in a radiation experiment, and he needed her to use her powers to vibrate his heart until Gorgon could return with medicine. Crystal was finally forced to leave the team when she passed out and Reed discovered that Earth's pollutants were slowly killing her. Johnny took it badly, but Reed stopped him before he could jump into Lockjaw's teleportation field. |||| |||| En route to Attilan, Crystal rescued and tended the wounded Quicksilver. A whirlwind romance ensued, and by the time Quicksilver had recovered, they were engaged. Crystal and Quicksilver were married and settled down in Attilan, the first-ever Inhuman marriage to a non-Inhuman. At first, Crystal and Pietro were very happy together, especially after Crystal gave birth to their daughter Luna; but serious tensions arose. Pietro wanted to expose Luna to the Terrigan Mists rather than have her remain an ordinary girl, but Crystal forbade it. Quicksilver immersed himself in his role as commander of the Inhuman militia, while a lonely and bored Crystal had an affair with a real estate salesman Norm Webster. When Pietro found out, he went mad and fled Attilan. Crystal rejoined the Fantastic Four, trying unsuccessfully to rekindle her old romance with Johnny. |||| |||| Pietro eventually recovered from his breakdown, and he and Crystal have made several attempts at reconciliation, including a period during which they served together as Avengers. Crystal joined their ranks as her way of atoning for her various personal failures. However, Crystal's romantic link to the team's Black Knight helped sour the marriage yet again, and the couple have been separated as of late."

2402,Doorman (Marvel)(01 - DeMarr Davis),DeMarr Davis ,2402_20060305153504_char.jpg,"Doorman is a class-10 teleporter, meaning that he is capable of teleporting someone anywhere, but with the limitation that it has to be in the next room. His mutant ability operates by tapping into the Darkforce dimension, as several other Marvel Universe teleporters (such as Cloak, the Vanisher, Silhouette, etc.) do. Originally, his all-black appearance was a costume of apparently conventional material, with stark white eyepieces in the mask as contrast. However, since becoming Oblivion's servant, his Doorman 'body' seems to be an assumed shape rather than a simple costume, and he can transform at will from this form to his non-costumed self. |||| |||| He also gained the ability to collect the souls of the recently deceased and deliver them to Oblivion; while doing so, he appears visible only to the soul he is collecting, and possibly also his teammate Mr. Immortal, who could perceive the original Deathurge. What other new powers he has gained from his new position, if any, are currently unknown.",,"Little is known of Doorman's life before he responded to Mr. Immortal's advertisement for a hero team. This team would eventually become the Great Lakes Avengers. It has been revealed however that he is a mutant. |||| |||| Before joining the Great Lakes Avengers, DeMarr Davis was an average American youngster. Sometime during his years in college, DeMarr's mother died. After completing four years of college and three years of graduate school, DeMarr decided to answer Mr. Immortal's newspaper ad asking 'costumed adventurers' to join together and form a team. DeMarr, being a mutant and possessing his unique teleporting ability, is able to allow his teammates entrance into almost any structure, thus creating both a stealthy entrance as well as a surprise attack. He joined the original incarnation of the Great Lakes Avengers. |||| |||| Doorman is however, the most cynical of the Great Lakes Avengers, constantly comparing the team to the real Avengers, usually at the most inappropriate times, and feeling at times embarrassed by his friends. Nonetheless, DeMarr cares for them deeply, and values each and every member of the team. He was responsible for creating the fallen GLA'ers memorial at GLA HQ. |||| Doorman in action. |||| Doorman in action. |||| |||| He also still blames himself for the death of one of their newest recruits, the Grasshopper, who died in battle with Batroc and his minions. Zaran (one of Batroc's henchmen) threw a sai at Doorman, who quickly activated his powers, only for the blade to land directly in the head of Grasshopper (who was standing right behind him), killing him instantly. DeMarr feels that it is his fault that Grasshopper died and therefore sunk into a slight depression. During this time he also tried to scare another new member, Squirrel Girl off of the team because he feared that she too would die while in service to the GLA. |||| |||| Doorman himself has died as well, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop the villain Maelstrom. He met with the other dead GLA'ers in the afterlife including Grasshopper who forgave him. Doorman was however intrigued by the absence of Hawkeye. Shortly afterwards, he was summoned by the cosmic entity Oblivion, who declared that thanks to Doorman's connection to the Darkforce dimension, Doorman could prove useful to him, akin to Deathurge who had recently been captured by Mr. Immortal. Doorman therefore replaced Deathurge and became Oblivion's new angel of death. |||| |||| Taking Deathurge's place, Doorman took Maelstrom to the afterlife after he was tricked into killing himself by Mr. Immortal, and was able to return to the GLA. What other effects his new role as servant of Oblivion have had on him have yet to be revealed. Doorman continues to be a member of the GLA, although after he helped his friends save the world from Maelstrom, he understands the team's importance and has a newfound respect for them. However, a subpoena from the real Avengers forced the team to change their name to the Great Lakes X-Men or GLX. |||| |||| Some time after the battle with Maelstrom, Doorman was celebrating Christmas with the rest of the GLX when he informed the team that he had to go and visit his father. Upon reaching his father's house, his father quickly complained that DeMarr was throwing his life away and needed to join the real world. He told his son that he had 'stupid powers' and 'all the other heroes have better powers than you.' Realizing that his own happiness was more important than his father's respect, DeMarr finally admitted the truth to his father: that he had died and came back as the angel of death. He had not come back to visit his father but rather to collect his soul as he had fallen off the roof while setting up Christmas lights and died. Ironically, the revelation of DeMarr's new role in the universe greatly pleased his father, who couldn't wait to brag to all his friends in heaven about how his son was the new angel of death. |||| |||| Doorman and his teammates recently participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the Thing, where Flatman beat their host in the final round. Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to take the new name of the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the Defenders by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring former Champions of Los Angeles member Hercules' protests."

144,Dragon Man (Marvel),,144_20070225211314_char.jpg,"The android Dragon Man is capable of flight with its massive wings, able to breath fire, is super-strong, and can use its prehensile tail to wrap around objects and hurl them.",,"The Dragon Man is an android creation of State University’s Professor Gregson Gilbert, who created him as a powerful monster, able to best even the Fantastic Four. Though his original design was purely for study and research. However, the alchemist Diablo soon escaped from his melted, stone prison and offered Gilbert the means to animate the Dragon Man. Gilbert had no choice but to accept and together they used Diablo’s potions and a chunk of rock from outer space to give life to Dragon Man. |||| |||| Diablo immediately ordered Dragon Man to destroy his enemies, the Fantastic Four, starting with the Thing, who had witnessed his animation. The Dragon Man dutifully attacked Ben, and later, the rest of the Fantastic Four. He used his fire breath on the Human Torch, who absorbed it, but was forced to fly into the upper atmosphere to release the pent up heat before he melted everything around him. To save her brother, the Invisible Girl pinned his wings and the Dragon Man fell to the earth. She sensed that Dragon Man was not malicious, however, and tried to comfort him. He responded to her touch by reaching out to stroke her hair, but Diablo returned and gassed the three members of the Fantastic Four with a freezing potion. |||| |||| Along with his creator, Professor Gilbert, Dragon Man and Diablo faced the Fantastic Four minutes later at the edge of Dead Man’s Lake. But before Diablo could throw another freezing pellet at the four, Dragon Man lashed out with his tail and knocked the pellet out of Diablo’s hand, accidentally freezing the lake instead. Dragon Man then chased Diablo across the frozen lake until they fell through, into the bitter-cold waters. The Thing tried to follow but found that the lake had caves underneath that created a vicious undertow and they gave Diablo and the Dragon Man up as lost. But his creator stayed behind at State U to hold a vigil over the lake in case Dragon Man ever returned, so that he could undo the wrong that had been done in his creation. |||| |||| Soon, a struggle between the Human Torch and the Inhuman Medusa changed the temperature of Dragon Man’s prison enough to allow him to break free. He attacked them, but confused Medusa for the Invisible Girl, and guarded her. He continued to guard her as the Fantastic Four fought her and her Inhuman family, until Susan encouraged him to join them, but was forced to tranquilize him later when the Thing startled him into anger. Eventually the Seeker, who confused him for an Inhuman, captured him; but when he realized he was of the Earth, he had no more use for him. Though the Dragon Man awoke in shackles and broke out, full of distrust for the human race once again, until the Torch and the Thing managed to subdue him. Mister Fantastic later contacted the authorities who took him to a Desert Isle Sanctuary, under heavy sedation, for examination."
7850,Asgardian (Marvel),William Kaplan ,7850_20070813220104_char.jpg,"As Wiccan, Billy Kaplan possesses a spellcasting talent that may or may not be related to a reality warping power. While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning based spells. Also he can astral project by fear until he learns how to control it. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down forcefields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, and telekinetic force beams. |||| |||| It was revealed in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways that Billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others,and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.",,"Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Reform Jews Jeff Kaplan (a cardiologist ) and Rebecca Kaplan (a psychologist) |||| |||| Regularly bullied in school, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash heals Billy's wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied, and demonstrates his powers for the first time, but is not fully prepared for their effects. |||| |||| He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan. |||| |||| The full extent of his powers are unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from 'self-help books' owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, 'I want Iron Lad to forget') and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen. |||| |||| Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. |||| |||| In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd, the Young Avenger Speed, and Billy. |||| |||| During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War. |||| |||| S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. |||| |||| When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, 'I want you to die.' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. |||| |||| Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. |||| |||| Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells. |||| ||||"
1281,Terrax the Tamer (Marvel),Tyros ,1281_20070113201446_char.jpg,"Terrax was apparently born with a limited mental control over rock and earth, which he used to create simple constructs. After his powers were enhanced by Galactus, his ability increased in terms of volume and complexity. He was also awarded superhuman strength and durability, as well as abilities including force field projection, matter manipulation, the power to fuse machinery, energy absoprtion (usually through his axe), resistance to telepathy, and more. Like all of Galactus's Heralds, he is immune to the vacuum of space. His cosmic-powered axe is magically sharp and can generate waves of force (he himself can project personal energy attacks as well). Originally he could fly through space on his own by riding masses of stone which he levitated, but after taking over a human body (Harmon Furmintz, the creator of Psionex), he needed the additional power of his axe to travel through space. Terrax is also a gifted and adaptable close combat fighter.",,"Terrax was originally known as Tyros, ruler of the city Lanlak on the planetoid Birj, which was a satellite of the gas giant Marman. Tyros possessed limited powers over the elements of earth and he abused these powers in order to become tyrant over his people. Tyros was ruthless and cruel, which brought him to the attention of Galactus, who had decided that the weakness of his former Heralds had been their compassion. Galactus compelled the Fantastic Four against their will to retrieve Tyros for him, in exchange for assisting the Four in combatting the Sphinx. |||| |||| Empowered with the 'Power Cosmic,' Tyros became 'Terrax the Tamer, master of all things rock and earth.' But his ambition and power-lust drove him to challenge Galactus, who easily defeated him by stripping away the power cosmic. |||| |||| Later, in the 'Trial of Galactus' story-arc in Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom used his technological expertise to restore some of Terrax's former power, in exchange for his help in destroying the Fantastic Four. During the battle, Silver Surfer appeared and ultimately destroyed him. |||| |||| Notable appearances include New Warriors issue #1, in which a re-embodied Terrax is the threat that unites the fledgling super-hero team; and Fantastic Four Issue #258, in which he waxes nostalgic about his destructive powers. Shortly afterward, Terrax engaged the Silver Surfer and was marooned on an uninhabited, grassy planet and his axe was cast into a nearby asteroid field. During the Herald Ordeal, Silver Surfer lead a group of former Galactean heralds in opposition to Morg, Galactus' then Herald. In Silver Surfer #74, Terrax was the last former herald that the Silver Surfer collected by saving him from that unnamed planet and finding his axe. In issue #75, Terrax joins the other heralds in battling Morg. Morg and Terrax take almost instantly to a rivalry, as they are the only two heralds that wield axes and both enjoy fights. During the battle, Terrax' axe crumbles and Morg successfully knocks him out. After the battle, Terrax takes the recently deceased Morg's axe and takes to the stars on an asteroid, content to never see any of his allies again. Presumably between Silver Surfer #75 and #81, Terrax is captured by Tyrant where he is held with several others who are less than enthusiastic to share his company. Terrax and his fellow prisoners manage to free themselves, and Terrax again takes off, wanting only to be left alone. |||| |||| In the Cosmic Powers mini-series, Terrax is recruited by Thanos of Titan to again fight Tyrant. Issue #2 focuses on Terrax, and opens with him fighting in a very Roman looking arena. He wins the battle and wins the one thing he probably has the least use for in all the world - a beautiful woman. She leads him into the desert with promises of riches for her safe return, but he is ambushed by her brothers. Thanos comes in at the tail end of the slaughter, and the woman appeals to him to save her from Terrax, to which his response is that she had made her bed and it was time to lie in it. Terrax lets Thanos know that he is ready to battle him, and Thanos replies that he offers vengeance against Tyrant. Terrax then helps Thanos recruit Ganymede and eventually Legacy and Jack of Hearts, who are collectively betrayed by Thanos. While Thanos is battling Tyrant, Terrax and the others flee in Thanos' craft, the Demeter. |||| |||| Another notable appearance was in the humor book the GLX Christmas Special, where he and other villains were beaten easily by Squirrel Girl. |||| |||| He also appeared in the The Sentry as a momentary annoyance mostly to display Sentry's level of power. He takes Terrax's axe away from him and further humiliates 'the tamer' by shattering it with his bare hands. Terrax's portrayal in the series has been called into question, as he uncharacteristically and inexplicably is first found fighting random helicopters on Earth and babbling about pseudo-environmental outrages. |||| |||| In the events of Annihilation: Silver Surfer, Terrax has been captured by Annihilus' forces for an unknown purpose. In the Heralds of Galactus two parter following the events of Annihilation Terrax is freed from the control of the negative zone life forms and with Paibok and the infant like alien escapes to a desolate planet controlled by Randu the space parasite. Terrax destroys it but looses a female Centaurion who he seems to have been attracted to during the battle. In his anger over her loss and the dismayed behavior of Randu's other victims who had come to rely on their captur he destroys the planet. He is currently flying about through space and at this time its unknown what if any part he will play in Annihilation: Conquest."
14839,Twitch Williams,Maximilian Steven Percival 'Twitch' Williams III ,14839_20100608102818_char.jpg,,,"In this duo of detectives Twitch is mainly seen as the 'brains' of the group. He is the one who usually solves or puts the pieces together in the rare crimes the detectives encounter. A brilliant mathematician who excelled at trigonometry, he has used his knowledge of angles to become an excellent marksman. A shooting prodigy, Twitch makes up for his small size with his ability to handle twin pistols with almost machine-like accuracy and efficiency. He earned the nickname 'Twitch,' as Sam once said, 'because he doesn't, ever!' He refers to Sam Burke as 'sir,' as throughout the years Sam has, time and time again, earned his trust and respect. At the beginning of their story/comic book we find the two employed as a private investigation firm known as 'Burke and Williams' however, this does not last, since the two are called back into duty by their old captain. |||| |||| Twitch was once married and has several children, but due to his busy schedule with crime cases, his wife eventually divorced him, and denies him custody of his kids. This has a great emotional impact on Twitch, but does not seem to hinder him from his work. Twitch comes from a family with a proud tradition in law enforcement, his father and siblings all being cops themselves. Despite his reserved and soft-spoken manner, he is extremely passionate and proud of his job, in some ways more so than Sam. It is because of this that, despite his incredible intelligence, the apparent rampant corruption of the Police Department which he works for troubles him greatly. In some ways, Twitch is a little more naïve than the street-smart and more realistic Sam, and has had to deal with many harsh truths. Despite this, however, Twitch never loses his resolve to be a good cop, even amongst corruption and a city that generally doesn't trust the police. Twitch often makes better relations with people than his partner, due to his kinder, more thoughtful way with people. |||| |||| Twitch has also battled against many super-human foes in his past. Of particular note is OvertKill, a monstrous, mafia-hired cyborg from the Spawn comic series. Despite OvertKill's seemingly-bulletproof exterior, Twitch was able to defeat him with a single, well-aimed bullet through OvertKill's ear canal. While Twitch lacks Sam's strength, size, and tenacity, he makes up for it with calm and collected nerves of steel and immensely quick thinking under pressure. Combined with his marksmanship, he's not one to be trifled with."

Denied help from the CBI, Danny called in the Titans, revealing whilst rescuing his parents that he had strong telekinetic powers.

2296,Plasmus,Otto Von Furth ,2296_20070502231139_char.jpg,"With his radioactive and chemically-converted body, Plasmus' touch can bring a fiery death onto his opponents reverting them to a protoplasmic state. The touch has no cure and no one has withstood it. Plasmus can also loosen his cells so that bullets can't hurt him. He is also able to gather his body if it is scattered while in its less cohesive state. In a certain sense, he is almost identical to the sinister Preston Payne, the third Clayface. Both can, as noted above, melt people into protoplasmic jelly, are little less than inhuman themselves, and have a great deal of control above their bodies.",,"Otto Von Furth was a mine worker in East Berlin, Germany until an unexpected cave-in trapped him and four fellow miners for seven days. During those days, Otto's co-workers died, leaving him as the only survivor. He and his fellow miners had been mining for radioactive radium and ended up exposed to it and when rescued, he was rushed to the hospital. Otto was later kidnapped by Ex-Nazi General Zahl who mutated him into a blob-like state. With his anger, Otto became Plasmus. His body changed into an unstable protoplasm and he was brought into the Brotherhood of Evil where he took the name Plasmus. He and the Brotherhood of Evil fought the Teen Titans on different occasion where he enjoys fighting and regretting not being the one to kill General Zahl. The rest of the Brotherhood of Evil reformed into the Society of Sin. He was later recruited into Lex Luthor's Suicide Squad where he died fighting Imperiex."

394,Black Knight (Marvel)(03 - Dane Whitman),Dane Whitman ,394_20060314171247_char.jpg,"Highly intelligent, Dane is a trained unarmed combatant, superb swordsman, and expert horseman. Though specializing in physics, he is proficient in a wide array of advanced sciences and technologies, including genetic and mechanical engineering. He has strong strategic and tactical skills. |||| |||| Dane's past weapons include the legendary Ebony Blade, his power lance and his laser sword. The Ebony Blade, created by the wizard Merlin, is an indestructible, enchanted sword forged of magic and a unique meteorite that fell to Earth in the Middle Ages. It can cut through any substance as well as deflect energy and penetrate energy fields, including those of mystical forces. Its owner could also transport the Blade to him through a magical bond. The Ebony Blade was also enchanted with a “blood curse,” so that, should its wielder use the blade in an unworthy manner to kill, he would be overwhelmingly compelled to use the sword to spill more blood. Once, Whitman believed the curse to be lifted, but his former apprentice Sean Dolan has since succumbed to it, becoming the murderous Bloodwraith under the Blade's influence. |||| |||| Dane's original weapon was his power lance, a device adapted from the designs of his criminal uncle; it was a lance outfitted with a variety of hidden weapons, including heat beams, force beam projectors, gas emitters and bolas that could enwrap opponents. He has very seldom used the lance since adopting his various swords. |||| |||| His laser sword, also known as his neural sword or photonic sword, is a hand-held device that generates a 'blade' of light; this blade could be adjusted to various settings, including a penetrating laser that could cut through almost anything and an immaterial energy column that could disrupt a victim's nervous system without doing physical damage. |||| |||| Paraphernalia |||| When Dane Whitman touches his mystic pendant and invokes the name of Avalon, he conjures up his equipment and steed. The armor and weapons are extremely lightweight but supernaturally durable. His Shield of Night not only protects him from most attacks but also absorbs the energy of the forces directed against it. He can then release that stored energy in the form of power blasts from his blade, the Sword of Light. Strider can fly at great speeds and is even capable of travel underwater. While riding Strider, Dane is magically able to breathe regardless of his environment. |||| |||| Before acquiring Strider, Dane rode Aragorn, Valinor and an atomic steed. Aragorn is a horse whom Dane gave wings and the power of flight through genetic engineering techniques created by his criminal uncle. When Dane's first time trip to the era of the Crusades separated him from Aragorn, the horse was adopted by another adventurer, Brunnhilde the Valkyrie. Aragorn remains in Valkyrie's custody to this day, with Dane's blessing. During his time in the Twelfth Century, Dane adopted a mystical winged horse named Valinor. Unfortunately, Valinor was stolen away by the Bloodwraith. For a time, Dane used an atomic steed, one of the mechanical flying vehicles of the High Evolutionary's Knights of Wundagore. He has since abandoned it, though, and left it in storage at Avengers Mansion, where it was used by the Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne).",,"Nephew of the villainous Black Knight that went by the name of Nathan Garrett, Dane was summoned by his uncle when he was mortally wounded following a battle with Iron Man. With his last words his uncle confessed to his life of crime, and bid Dane to restore the honor of the Black Knight legacy. |||| |||| At first, Dane hoped to use merely his scientific expertise to be a force for good. However, his scientific experiments using magnetism to search for extraterrestrial life inadvertently brought Magneto and Toad back to Earth during a time when the mutant villains were believed lost in space. Magneto immediately began to re-form his Brotherhood, starting by kidnapping Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Whitman donned the costume and weapons of the Black Knight to track Magneto down but was confronted by the Avengers, who assumed him to be his uncle. The Black Knight helped the Avengers get on the right track but parted company with them, annoyed by their distrust. |||| |||| Nathan Garrett was posthumously contacted to join the Masters of Evil organized by the Crimson Cowl (actually, the robot Ultron, who was unaware of the villainous Knight's demise.) Whitman agreed to join the team with the hopes of infiltrating their ranks, and he tried to contact the Avengers before the attack. However, Ultron guessed at Whitman’s treachery, and the Masters intercepted him, beating him and leaving him abandoned. The Black Knight happened upon the discarded Jarvis, who was also abandoned by the Masters after being set-up to appear as if he were the Crimson Cowl. The Black Knight tracked down the Masters of Evil, helping the Avengers escape and overcome their foes. The heroes then parted on better terms, although Whitman still wanted to keep his distance. |||| |||| Whitman traveled to England hoping to sell the last of his inheritance from his uncle - Garrett Castle. There, he was contacted by the spirit of his ancestor Sir Percy of Scandia, the original Black Knight, in a similar way that his uncle had. However, in this case, Whitman proved worthy of pulling the Ebony Blade out of its scabbard. With it, he defeated the demonic guardian of the sword and, afterward, Le Sabre, a modern-day agent of Sir Percy's enemy, Mordred. |||| |||| Returning to America, the Black Knight met Doctor Strange through their mutual contact of Victoria Bentley. The two began working together, once against Tiboro and once, with the Avengers, against Surtur and Ymir. |||| |||| He encountered the Avengers again when they used as pawns by Kang in playing a game with the Grandmaster and his Squadron Sinister. His Ebony Blade was the prize in a contest between Goliath (Clint Barton) and the Whizzer, but by trying to help Goliath, the Black Knight interfered with the game and the Avengers, with his Ebony Blade, were returned to Kang's future. Thanks to the mystic properties of the sword, the Black Knight was able to transport himself to it, despite the distance of space and time. He helped the heroes escape and confront Kang, who demanded power from the Grandmaster to defeat the Avengers. Ultimately, it was the Black Knight, since he was not an Avenger, who managed to strike Kang down and allow them to return to the present. In gratitude, the Avengers extended an offer of membership, and Whitman accepted, although he opted for reserve status since he resided in England at the time in Garrett Castle. |||| |||| Over time, Whitman began feeling the curse of the Ebony Blade making him grow more violent, more bloodthirsty. When he nearly killed two jewel thieves after a pursuit, he sought to end the curse by destroying the blade. The search brought him to the magical dimension of Polemachus, but he was captured by Arkon and his erstwhile ally, the Enchantress. The Enchantress placed the Black Knight under a spell, keeping him in thrall even when the Avengers, warned of the Knight's fate by the Scarlet Witch's dream, came to rescue him. The Enchantress urged Arkon to battle the Avengers in hopes they would be destroyed, but the Black Knight lost his sword during the fight, and it fell into a magical well and was seemingly destroyed. Convinced of the truth, Arkon abandoned the Enchantress and the fight, allowing the Avengers and the Knight to return home. |||| |||| In fact, the blade was not destroyed but was lost in time, appearing in Olympus. Ares discovered it and, allying with the Enchantress who was following the blade, launched an assault upon Olympus. The Black Knight learned of this through the Brazier of Truth, and assembled the Avengers to storm the halls of Olympus. Ultimately, the Avengers were successful in stopping Ares’ rampage, recovering the Ebony Blade, and remanding the Enchantress to Zeus. She soon escaped, however, and sought out the Black Knight to use as her pawn, once more placing him under her spell with a kiss. They traveled to the dimension ruled by Casiolena, and the Enchantress sought revenge against her and the Executioner, who deserted her for Casiolena. The Defenders took refuge at Garrett Castle after rescuing Barbara Norriss from the Nameless One, and inadvertently stumbled into Casiolena’s dimension. The Enchantress transformed Barbara Norriss into the Valkyrie in order to aid her cause, and the Defenders were forced into battle as well. When Casiolena was defeated, the Enchantress and Executioner fled, but not before the witch cast the Black Knight aside, transforming him into stone. During this time, Valkyrie used his winged horse, Aragorn. |||| |||| Doctor Strange took the Black Knight's body with him to his Sanctum Sanctorum, hoping to someday reverse the curse. Eventually, Strange managed to contact the Black Knight’s spirit, lost in a nameless dimension, but the message was warped by Dormammu to force the Defenders and the Avengers to compete for the Evil Eye, a powerful mystic object that Strange was led to believe would be the Knight’s only salvation. In fact, Dormammu succeeded in using the Eye to nearly destroy the universe before being defeated, and the Eye couldn’t help the Black Knight, as his spirit had traveled to the Twelfth Century during the time of the Crusades. |||| |||| Through a spell cast at the time of Camelot's demise by Merlin, Whitman's spirit inhabited the body of his ancestor, Eobar Garrington, also known as the Black Knight. Whitman was thus able to try to track down Modred the Evil, the man who murdered Garrington. Modred had died centuries before but lived on as his spirit survived in the Twelfth Century, throwing events into chaos. Merlin's spell also brought the Defenders, who helped the Knight confront Modred, his allies, and his armies. Ultimately, Whitman decided to stay in the past, fighting in the Crusades on behalf of King Richard, and the Defenders returned home. |||| |||| At some point following the Crusades, the Black Knight joined the High Druid of Avalon, Amergin, in defending the realm of Avalon from attack by the Fomor, ancestral enemies of the English gods who wished to use Avalon to invade Earth. At the Knight's suggestion, Amergin used his modern-day descendant, Doctor Druid, to elicit the Avengers' aid. They hoped to use the Evil Eye to absorb enough energy to close the portal between Avalon and Earth, but it was the Black Knight who was forced to use the Eye, destroying his body in the process. Doctor Druid returned the Avengers to present-day Earth, and with his last vestiges of power, restored the stone body of Dane Whitman and transformed him back into flesh. He soon found a new steed in the winged horse, Valinor. |||| |||| The Black Knight tried to settle back into modern-day life, although much had changed in his absence. Victoria Bentley became the caretaker of Garrett Castle, purchasing it herself during Dane's years in the Crusades to prevent the British government from seizing the property for failure to pay taxes. He also took a young Irish orphan, Sean Dolan, under his wing, becoming a guardian and mentor. However, over time, Whitman began experiencing increasing madness and bloodthirstiness. Doctor Strange revealed that the Ebony Blade had been cursed by its original owner, Sir Percy of Scandia, by spilling blood when he was in possession of the blade. Doctor Strange contacted and appealed to Sir Percy's spirit, allowing it to reside in the blade, and thereby removed the curse, warning Whitman not to inflict the sword with any curses of his own. During this time, Valinor had lost his wings and was retired. |||| |||| The Black Knight returned to America, where he took on full active membership again. During this time, he began riding a mechanical 'Atomic Steed' for his mount. He also developed a romantic crush on his fellow Avenger, the Wasp, but she didn't share Dane's feelings and he was soon forced to abandon his intentions. He did, however, became romantically interested in his admirer, the female Yellowjacket. |||| |||| Sometime later, his personality seemed to grow more medieval and archaic. When the Avengers' associate, Marrina, underwent her own transformation into a huge savage sea creature resembling the mythical Leviathan, she began sinking several fleets of ships and ravaging the undersea world of Atlantis. The Avengers hunted her down, but ultimately it was her husband, the Sub-Mariner, who took Whitman's Ebony Blade from him and dealt a mortal blow to Marrina. Whitman immediately felt the effects of the blood-curse on the blade, which took the effect of slowly transforming him into a living extension of his Ebony Blade. As such, he began to cut the people and objects he touched and gradually found it harder to move. |||| |||| The Black Knight was forced to leave the Avengers in the company of his teammate Thor, who hoped to find a cure for Whitman's condition in the realm of Asgard. However, at the time Asgard became embroiled in a battle against the Egyptian death god Seth and his army. Ultimately, Thor used the Knight's cursed, blade-like body to kill Seth. Thor then took the Knight’s body back to Earth, placing it in the care of Doctor Strange. Dane Whitman was restored to normal through the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, his friends Victoria Bentley and Sean Dolan, and the spirit of Sir Percy. |||| |||| The Black Knight soon returned to the Avengers, having abandoned his Ebony Blade in favor of a high-tech laser sword. More determined and driven than before, the Knight grew into one of the Avengers' most prominent members, even serving as unofficial field leader under the Black Widow. His drive in the Avengers led him to become more ruthless than before, even to the point of advocating the assassination of the alien Supreme Intelligence for its role in sparking war between the Kree and Shi'ar alien races. Also, Whitman began neglecting Valinor, his squire Dolan, and his benefactor Victoria Bentley. |||| |||| Sean Dolan later used the Ebony Blade, becoming possessed by it and being transformed into the demonic Bloodwraith, killing Victoria Bentley and stealing Valinor for himself. More poignantly, Whitman and Bentley had just begun to entertain a potential romance before her death. Dane defeated the Bloodwraith, but Dolan escaped, becoming one of Whitman's most bitter foes. |||| |||| The Black Knight soon found himself in a love triangle involving himself and two of his teammates, the Inhuman, Crystal, and the Eternal, Sersi. Dane was in love with Crystal, the estranged wife of Quicksilver, but was also strongly attracted to the mentally unstable Sersi, who was madly in love with him and forced Dane to mentally bond with her. When Quicksilver returned to the group and seemed prepared to reconcile with Crystal, Dane unselfishly renounced his feelings for her. About the same time, the Avengers were attacked by Whitman's counterpart from another dimension, the Proctor, who was determined to kill Sersi in revenge for what her counterpart had done to him, including the mental-bonding process. The Black Knight helped defeat the Proctor and resigned himself to accompany Sersi in her exile to another dimension as her growing mental instability made her too dangerous to remain on Earth. |||| |||| During their adventures in other dimensions, Sersi regained her emotional stability and Dane spent some time with a super-team called Ultraforce, even becoming its leader. He and Sersi eventually decided to return to their own Earth, though, and managed to do so after an accidental side trip to the Crusades, during which Dane earned the friendship and enmity of Bennet du Paris, a power-mad knight who survived into modern times as the mutant terrorist Exodus, leader of the Acolytes. On returning to present-day Earth, Dane and Sersi split up. The Avengers were temporarily disbanded at the time, so the Black Knight found a new home and new employment at Oracle Incorporated, joining the company's new super-team, Heroes for Hire. At about the same time, Dane was contacted by the Lady of the Lake, who informed him that he was fated to be the champion of Avalon, the mystical Celtic realm the Black Knight had been allied with during his time in the Twelfth Century. The Lady of the Lake gave the Knight a new magical winged steed and mystical weapons to better battle evil in Avalon's name. |||| |||| The Black Knight continued to battle evil as a member of Heroes for Hire and as an inactive member of the Avengers, until Heroes for Hire's disbanding. In one of the team's final missions, they encountered on Mt. Wundagore the humanoid animals created by the High Evolutionary. The Black Knight elected to stay on Wundagore to lead these 'New Men' as the Knights of Wundagore. |||| |||| The Black Knight later broke away from the New Men in order to join his fellow Avengers in various adventures. One such adventure brought the Black Knight to the country of Slorenia, where the Bloodwraith was ravaging the land. The Knight hoped to remain near Slorenia to finally defeat the Bloodwraith, but he rejoined the Avengers during their war against Kang, who nearly succeeded in conquering Earth. The Black Knight parted company with the Avengers yet again after the battle with Kang was over."

This power, though, is more magical than scientific, owing to its origin from the Starheart, which also powers her father's Green Lantern ring. She had a telepathic link to her brother, Obsidian. |||| |||| When she lost her primary power after a battle with the Starheart itself, she derived a similar power from a Green Lantern Corps ring, making her briefly, technically, a Corps member. |||| |||| In the modern era, most of her original power set has returned, meaning that her Green Lantern-like powers are ones she produces without the assistance of a ring or other object. |||| |||| In addition to these super powers, she's also endowed with innate leadership skills, with which she has guided the Outsiders and various other groups.",,"She was very briefly the GL for Earth's sector, serving in Kyle Rayner's absence when previous Green Lanterns of Earth refused the ring when Kyle left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps.

1736,Fin Fang Foom (Marvel),,1736_20060522135327_char.jpg,"As a member of a race of aliens known as Makluans or Kakaranatharans, Fin Fang Foom possesses superhuman strength, the ability to fly via his wings at supersonic speeds, and can spew combustible acid mist from his mouth (making him appear to 'breathe fire'). The dragon is also extremely durable and can regenerate at a rapid rate. By entering into long periods of hibernation, Fin Fang Foom has managed to survive for centuries. Fin Fang Foom is also a shape-shifter who can change size and shape to appear either as a human being or as a dragon far larger than a normal Kakaranatharan. He possesses a gifted intellect, and can communicate telepathically. He is 44 feet long, including his tail, and weighs 2 tons in his normal state. |||| |||| Fin Fang Foom has a vulnerability to an unnamed herb which can induce slumber. |||| |||| He excels in hand to hand combat, and is a master of the martial arts of the planet Kakaranathara. He uses a Makluan starship built by the technicians of Kakaranathara, for interstellar transportation.",,"Although once believed to be a native of the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon in China, the creature later known as Fin Fang Foom is an alien being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu system of the Greater Magellanic Cloud. The alien and several other members of his race originally depart from their peaceful home-world with the intention of conquering other planets. The alien, as a member of the starship's crew, serves as the navigator. The alien dragons land on Earth in ancient China, and the crew used their natural shape-shifting powers to mimic human form, intent on entering and studying human society before beginning their conquest. The alien navigator was the exception, and acting as reserve is placed in a tomb and given an herb that places him in a catatonic state. |||| |||| The alien is briefly awakened in the 8th Century, where he is given the name Fin Fang Foom and called a 'dragon' due to his species' resemblance to mythological Asian dragons, and returns to sleep with a second application of the herb. Foom sleeps until the modern age, when he is deliberately awakened by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from invading forces of the Communist Party of China. Liuchow taunts Foom with the threat of the herb, and goads the dragon into chasing him straight into the Communist camp, which Foom decimates. Liuchow subsequently leads him back into his tomb, where the herb returns Foom to his sleep. At some point, the sleeping Fin Fang Foom is captured by the Elder of the Universe known as the Collector, and imprisoned in his subterranean collection of monsters. When the Mole Man attacks the facility, Foom and the other monsters escape  and are later captured by the recently-formed Fantastic Four and deposited on Monster Isle. Foom, however, has no desire to serve the Mole Man (who uses the island as a base) and leaves, returning to China and hibernation. |||| |||| Sometime later a scientist called Doctor Vault manages to mentally control the dragon and attack Vault's foe It the Living Colossus. Resisting the control, Foom instead aids the Colossus against an alien invasion - intent on preserving the planet for the dragon's own race to conquer at a later date. Vault's mind control briefly forces Foom to battle the Colossus; Foom overpowers his opponent with martial arts before freeing his mind and returning to hibernation yet again. |||| |||| Years later, Fin Fang Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the demon Aan Taanu. Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as the Legion of Night in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the confused Foom once again returns to hibernation. |||| |||| At some point in the modern age the Makluan vessel is found by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and eventually becomes the supervillain the Mandarin. |||| |||| Years later the Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by the captain of the vessel - in human guise - and finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one third of China. He is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara, and with fellow alien 'Chen Hsu,' he begins to summon his fellow 'dragons' who had been disguised as humans for centuries. When the other Makluans shed their human forms to begin their conquest, the Mandarin realizes he is being used and joins forces with the superheroes Iron Man and War Machine to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation. |||| |||| Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, his spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a conduit for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom once again, with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind. Due to several legal complications, however, the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle again, where he and several other monsters go on to briefly battle the dimensionally-displaced Justice League of America. |||| |||| Tired of the constant defeats and with the other members of the Makluan crew dead, Foom decides to reform and becomes a follower of Buddhism. He enters into a rehabilitation program, which sees himself and three other monsters - the robot Elektro, the giant ape Gorgilla and the alien Googam - shrunk down to human size, hypnotically stripped of their powers, and allowed to enter human society. Taking up a job as head chef in a Chinese restaurant within the Baxter Building, Foom teams up with the other monsters to defeat the size-changing warlord Tim Boo Baa as the 'Fin Fang Four.' |||| |||| Foom later appears as a pawn of the Beyond Corporation©, and while having reverted back to its' original size, lacks any real intelligence. Foom is eventually defeated by Aaron Stack, who allows himself to be swallowed by the dragon and then eviscerates it internally.  'Fin Fang Four' writer Roger Langridge notes that if given the opportunity to do a further Fin Fang Foom story, he would explain that the Beyond Corporation's Foom was merely a clone of Foom made when intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. took a sample of his DNA years ago. |||| |||| Fin Fang Foom later reappears, still in shrunken form, and begrudgingly aids Wong - the servant of Dr. Strange - in defeating a force of HYDRA agents."

Using a fuel made of the same meteoric materials that Reed Richards used to create his, Ivan launched a spaceship at the precise time that the Fantastic Four launched their own into space. Ivan crewed his ship with a trio of apes that he had trained to operate the ship, repair its machinery, and fire weapons, which he kept under-fed so that they would continue to obey him. And because Ivan had spent time researching the Fantastic Four, he was prepared for the cosmic rays he would encounter along the way, though unlike the four heroes, Ivan constructed his spaceship out of transparent, ceramic plastic to allow as much of the cosmic rays to filter through as possible. So that once he had reached space, Ivan and his three apes were bombarded by an intense dose of the rays, more than the Fantastic Four before them. Ivan’s Gorilla became super-strong; his orangutan gained control of magnetism; and the baboon gained the ability to transform into other objects at will. Ivan Kragoff, himself, became the Red Ghost, with the power to make his body insubstantial, allowing him to pass through solid objects. |||| |||| |||| Once the Red Ghost and his Super Apes reached the Blue Area of the Moon, they found an abandoned city as well as a more modern, inhabited dwelling. They also found the Fantastic Four’s Thing, and fought with him until Uatu The Watcher appeared and stopped the apes and the two combatants. He explained that his species observed others, but never interfered. However, Earth was becoming dangerously close to a devastating clash between the United States and Russia, which might reduce the human race to savagery and barbarism. He also announced that the Red Ghost and the Fantastic Four must fight to decide the battle. |||| |||| |||| The Red Ghost and his Apes fought the Fantastic Four until Reed designed a paralyzing ray that enabled him to freeze the Red Ghost who could not otherwise be touched. Then, while the Watcher explained that he would have to move his base to a new place, now that humans were capable of traveling to the moon, the Red Ghost’s gorilla released him from his paralysis. But when the Red Ghost tried to control them, after the Invisible Girl had fed them, they turned on him and chased him across the moon. |||| |||| |||| He returned many times after, using his apes to fight the Fantastic Four. At one time he tried to strand the Fantastic Four on the Moon, but they escaped to the Blue Area and soon fought back, knocking the Red Ghost into a portal and returning home. The Red Ghost was also one of the villains that Doctor Doom used to disrupt Reed and Sue's wedding. He attacked Susan and Alicia Masters, but Doctor Strange appeared and used his powers to send him to a distant nether world."

After a struggle with Deadman and Rama Kushna, Jonah was destroyed and the Sensei resumed control of his body. For a brief time, the Sensei assumed leadership of the League of Assassins. |||| |||| By this stage The Sensei was clearly insane (if he had not been before) with no goals other than to raise assassination to an artform. Among other crimes he used Bronze Tiger, the brainwashed partner of Richard Dragon, to carry out a number of assassinations. Most notably used The Bronze Tiger to occupy Batman in battle, while other assassins killed Batman's friend Kathy Kane. |||| |||| He next attempted to kill a number of dignitiaries by having the League plant explosives along a fault line, stating that using a force of nature to carry out an assassination would be his greatest work of art. Although Batman arrived in time to rescue the deligates, he was unable to stop the earthquake. With no time to pursue The Sensei himself, Batman was forced to allow Ra's al Ghul to go after the assassin. Sensei then engaged himself in a fight to the death with Ra's al Ghul, during which both of them were swallowed by the earthquake. Ra's lived thanks to his rejuvenating Lazarus Pit.

By purchasing the GG, Kingpin now technically owns Spider-Man's likeness. After Iron Fist betrayed the Ultimate Knights team's intentions to him, he had Spider-Man captured and waves this information in front of him, citing it as the only reason he would allow Spider-Man to continue to roam free. At the same time, he has Moon Knight assaulted and taken away, and torches Daredevil's offices. In retaliation, a crazed Daredevil breaks into Fisk's offices and threatens to murder his comatose wife by snapping her neck.

She had sent a small band of her most trusted aides to Sanctuary II to repair its hyper-drive engines and teleport the station out of the solar system, but the activity coincided with the arrival of the hero Monica Rambeau (as Captain Marvel), who had been sent to investigate the craft by her team the Avengers. Nebula's minions warped the satellite out of the solar system with Captain Marvel aboard and rendezvoused with Nebula. |||| Nebula hoped to conquer the Skrull empire, at the time in the throes of chaos as their throneworld was destroyed by the planet-destroyer Galactus. Not knowing how to return home, Captain Marvel pretended to go along with Nebula's scheme but actually helped the Skrulls evacuate the outpost world Nebula was intent on destroying. The Avengers eventually located their missing member and allied themselves with the Skrulls to oppose her. Before the Avengers were able to catch up with Nebula, she annihilated both the Skrull outpost and the planet Xandar, home planet of the Avengers' ally Firelord. In battle with Nebula, the Avengers’ Starfox, brother of Thanos, learned that Nebula claimed to be Thanos' granddaughter, and thus his great-niece. Shortly thereafter, the virtually omnipotent Beyonder, curious about the Avengers, arrived, and in an attempt to help the Avengers vanquish Nebula, helped her and her minions to escape them by teleportlng them out of the Andromeda Galaxy. |||| |||| Nebula was later summoned to the side of Thanos, who had at the time assembled the Infinity Gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet and thereby give himself omnipotent power. Thanos scoffed at Nebula's claims to be his granddaughter, and as a gift to the embodiment of Death, transformed her into a hideous 'living sculpture' of pain and living death. Unfortunately for Thanos, he allowed himself to be distracted by an assemblage of the universe's heroes and thus failed to notice Nebula until she stole the Infinity Gauntlet for herself. Now omnipotent herself, she faced an entourage of cosmic beings that included Galactus, Master Order, and Lord Chaos. Soon, however, the original Soul Gem owner, Adam Warlock, subverted the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. Starfox elected to take Nebula into custody of the Eternals on the moon Titan. |||| |||| Somehow, under circumstances to be revealed, Nebula escaped and resumed her piracy career with her crew. They infiltrated a device known as the Infinity Union from the planet of the enigmatic alien Stranger.

The Atomic Compressor succeeded in negating all of reality, which led her into conflict with the Avengers once again. |||| |||| The Avengers, with their ally Spider-Man, defeated and captured the space pirate Nebula but an enraged Stranger burst in, searching for the Infinity Union, which had since absorbed the energies created from the negation of reality. Fearing that neither the Stranger nor anyone else was worthy of wielding such a dangerous device, the Avengers decide to track down the Infinity Union themselves. An increasingly unnerved Spider-Man, unaccustomed to dealing with cosmic menaces, found the device first-- and then accidentally set it off. Nebula had arranged to absorb the power of the Infinity Union and become a supreme being. The Avengers and the Stranger managed to thwart her regardless, stripping her of the Infinity Union's power, though Nebula managed to escape capture with her crewman Gunthar. |||| |||| Nebula's next appearance was a sudden attack on the young hero Nova. Nebula claimed that Nova had previously murdered her father Zorr, an archemeny of Nova Prime, the hero of Xandar whose powers Nova had inherited.

Originally part of the Tahuantinsuyu, they worshipped both the Incan and their own local gods until missionaries convinced them to reject their old beliefs for modern ways. However, Peliali, the Volcano Goddess, swore never to leave her home or her people. Though the Kamekeri kept in touch with the outside world the Costa Verde government officially learned of their existence only recently. |||| |||| Years ago Jamie Santiago returned from one of many journeys into the Andes with an infant girl he claimed was his by Peliali. Revealed as a shape-shifter at her christening, Lupe grew up teased by other children. When her father died, Lupe was taken in by the Church orphanage, despite their misgivings about her “ungodly” powers. When a TV ad brought the orphanage a letter from Edwin Jarvis they decided to make Lupe his sponsor, believing that his connections to Iron Man might be able to help her someday. Lupe began a correspondence with Jarvis that lasted several years, though not revealing her birthright. Agents of Moses Magnum learned of her powers while traveling to America and forced her to fight the Avengers while they stole a seismic cannon being shipped through JFK Airport. Lupe cooperated on the condition that no hostages or bystanders were killed. Once Magnum Force escaped, Lupe, now called Silverclaw, helped the Avengers retrieve the cannon. |||| |||| Lupe attended college classes until a telegram warned her of an old Costa Verde prophecy coming true. Once Silverclaw and the Avengers arrived they discovered that sorcerer Kulan Gath had transformed the Kamekeri into Hyborian Era (circa 10, 000 B.C.) versions of themselves and was intending to sacrifice Peliali in order to attain godhood and destroy the Earth. The Avengers were able to distract Gath long enough for Silverclaw to channel the belief of the Kamekeri into Peliali allowing her to escape and leaving Gath to the mercy of his demonic masters. |||| |||| Now an Avenger reservist, Silverclaw continued her studies while helping out against such foes as Ronan the Accuser, a homunculus of Estaban Diablo, and Kang. When the Avengers helped Mantis save her son Sequoia from one of the Thanosi (renegade Thanos duplicates), Silverclaw was attracted to the extra-dimensional Haywire, but his obsession with reviving his dead girlfriend Inertia ultimately destroyed him. Silverclaw also aided the Avengers when an extra-dimensional madman tried to merge their universe with his own and when an insane Scarlet Witch attempted to destroy the Avengers."

964,Mantis (Marvel)(01 - Celestial Madonna),Mandy Celestine ,964_20070103014659_char.jpg,"The powers she adapted from the Cotati enabled her to communicate telepathically with plants, survive in space, and transfer herself (and her son) from plant life to plant life across interstellar distances or inter-dimensionally. Once reborn, she could fire powerful energy blasts, form energy fields, communicate directly with cosmic beings such as Eternity and Death, and gained complete control of her personal energies as well as her physical form. Her mind, a human/plant hybrid, is largely immune to mental or metaphysical assault, and her physical durability is greatly enhanced. She can achieve a meditative state in which she is largely immune to physical, mental or spiritual harm. She also seems to have limited powers of flight, though it is possible these function only in the vacuum of space. |||| |||| Through training with the Priests of Pama, Mantis attained 'complete control' over her body, achieving peak human agility, the ability to accelerate her recuperative powers through force of will, and an empathic nature enabling her to sense the emotions of others as 'psychic vibrations.' Her mastery of the Priests' martial arts, which focus on manipulation of nerve endings and pressure points, has enabled her to knock out beings as powerful as Thor.",,"The enigmatic Mantis traces her roots back to the family of Vietnamese crimelord Monsieur Khruul who, disapproving of his sister Lua's marriage to German mercenary Gustav Brandt, hunted the couple across Indochina. The Brandts eluded him while Lua bore a child, but Khruul ultimately had their house burned to the ground, killing Lua and blinding Gustav, who fled with their infant daughter. They found sanctuary in the temple of the Priests of Pama, renegade pacifist members of the alien Kree race who were caretakers of the Cotati, a telepathic race of sentient plants. The Priests trained Gustav, granting him psychic sight, but separated him from his daughter, not wanting his violent nature to influence her development. Brandt eventually left the Temple, later joining the crime cartel Zodiac as Libra. |||| |||| Believing Mantis might grow to be the Celestial Madonna and mother the genetically perfect Celestial Messiah, the Priests of Pama trained Mantis in their martial arts, which she mastered, and gave her the name 'Mantis,' in recognition of her skill in defeating male opponents. They also taught her telepathic communication with the Cotati, which gave her empathic abilities. On Mantis' eighteenth birthday, the Priests removed Mantis' memories, implanting false memories of an orphaned life in Ho Chi Minh City, and sent her to experience life among normal humans. Meanwhile, the Shao-Lom monks of Titan, whose teachings also stemmed from the pacifist Kree's beliefs, mentored another possible Celestial Madonna: Earth-born orphan Heather Douglas, later known as Moondragon, but her sheltered life denied her insight into human existence, making her a less-rounded candidate. Moondragon would eventually return to Earth, becoming involved with the Avengers. |||| |||| As a bar girl coincidentally employed by her unwitting uncle, Monsieur Khruul, Mantis met the Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne), an adventurer turned alcoholic mercenary who worked for Khruul. Sensing a spark of nobility in the Swordsman and seeking a better life for herself, Mantis romanced and rehabilitated Duquesne, convincing him to return to America and rejoin the Avengers. She accompanied him, but had difficulty gaining the Avengers' trust after she deceived them, single-handedly taking down both Thor and Captain America as part of her plan to help the Avengers defeat the Lion God. Still, her abilities served the Avengers well; she aided the team during its Loki/Dormammu-masterminded Avengers-Defenders War; and against foes including the Collector, Klaw, and Ultron. Her empathic abilities helped save the universe when she deduced how Captain Mar-Vell could defeat the Cosmic Cube-empowered Thanos. |||| |||| During her association with the Avengers, Mantis became disenchanted with the Swordsman and began a slow seduction of the Vision, which further damaged Mantis' standing with the team. When the Avengers fought and defeated Zodiac, Libra was captured and revealed his identity as Mantis' father, telling her some portion of her history. Returning to the Pama temple, Mantis found the Priests slain by her uncle, who was in turn slain by the Star-Stalker, who had been kept imprisoned by the Priests. Though she still lacked her true memories, Mantis began doubting what she'd believed. |||| |||| Knowing the Celestial Madonna to be among them and hoping to father the Celestial Messiah himself, Kang attacked the Avengers. Defeated, he identified Mantis as the Celestial Madonna and attempted to kill her, but the Swordsman took the blast himself and died. Mantis, guilt-ridden and grief-stricken, buried the Swordsman in the garden of the Priests of Pama; however, the eldest Cotati reanimated the Swordsman's body and confirmed that Mantis was the Celestial Madonna. Immortus, Libra and the Cotati revealed the full history of Mantis, who accepted her destiny as the Celestial Madonna (to Moondragon's irritation). In a ceremony conducted by Immortus, Mantis and the Eldest Cotati wed (as did the Scarlet Witch and the Vision), after which the celestial couple transformed into energy and departed Earth. Before she departed, the Avengers declared Mantis an official member of their ranks. |||| |||| Merged with the Cotati's essence, Mantis gained Cotati abilities as well as her own, and began to evolve into 'the essence of life,' a change which physically manifested as a greenish hue in her skin. Conceiving the future Celestial Messiah, she left our universe, but even in other universes she found herself pursued -- on one alternate Earth she was aided by a league of justice-serving heroes against a mechanical construct which sought to prevent her child's birth. Eventually her son, Sequoia, was born, and Mantis attempted to raise him as normally as possible in the town of Willimantic, Connecticut. Dark forces rose against her, attempting to create an evil counterpart to her child, but she aided those who fought them; nothing eclipsed her attempts to raise the boy peacefully. |||| |||| When the fast-growing child reached an age when the Cotati race chose to parent him alone, Mantis again took to the stars, where she uncovered a plot by the Elders of the Universe to acquire the six Infinity Gems and destroy Galactus. Fearing this would destroy reality, Mantis located the Silver Surfer and traveled with him as he fought the Elders, bonding romantically with him. When the Gardener attacked her using the Soul Gem, she barely escaped and transferred herself to Shalla-Bal, the Surfer's former beloved on his homeworld. She and Shalla-Bal were both subsequently captured by the Elders. When the Elders attempted to destroy them both, Mantis sacrificed herself, allowing the Surfer to rescue Shalla-Bal. |||| |||| The power of the Elders' Infinity Gems proved too much for Mantis, who could not fully reconstruct herself, and fragments of her essence formed several 'shadow' Mantises. One shadow form awoke on Earth as an amnesiac, lacking powers. Seeking help, she aided the Avengers against the Voice and the High Evolutionary, and they in turn aided her in regaining her memories. The Fantastic Four then helped her try to return to her son, but Kang and Necrodamus interfered; after foiling them, Mantis returned to the stars as pure energy. The Silver Surfer encountered a shadow Mantis on Verdant, a plant world threatened by Galactus, and this Mantis aided the Surfer, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers in defeating Galactus and saving the Shi'ar homeworld. Over time, most shadow Mantises ceased to exist, fading even from the memories of those they'd encountered. During the Immortus-guided conspiracy known as The Crossing, the Avengers fought a Mantis seemingly allied with Kang, but this Mantis was ultimately revealed to be a Space Phantom, with no relation to either the true Mantis or her 'shadows.' |||| |||| Over time, the true Mantis began to recover as her scattered essence coalesced into five forms, each reflecting an aspect of her personality: freak, mother, lover, mystic, and Avenger. Thanos, a self-proclaimed god of death disturbed by the emergence of the Celestial Messiah and the Celestial Madonna as supposed deities of life, began killing fragmentary Mantises, unwittingly hastening the re-formation of the true Mantis, who was reborn as 'the goddess of life.' Fully restored, she teamed with the Avengers and the Squadron Supreme's Haywire to seek out Sequoia and defend him from Thanos, ultimately fighting beside Thanos to neutralize the reality-devouring Rot (though Thanos later claimed it was one of his Thanosi 'clones' who encountered Mantis). Mantis offered guidance to both young Avengers recruit Silverclaw, another potential goddess, and her own son, 'Quoi,' who had become bitter and rebellious during Mantis' absence but ultimately accepted his mother and his own role as the Celestial Messiah. During the Thanos conflict, Mantis and Vision (now long-separated from the Scarlet Witch) finally became lovers, but the Vision decided his mechanical nature made him ill-suited for a relationship with the maternal Mantis because their union could not produce children, and he broke off the romance. Mantis returned to Earth and was among the Avengers who faced the deranged Scarlet Witch."
203,Iron Man (Marvel)(01 - Tony Stark),Anthony Edward 'Tony' Stark ,203_20080930102826_char.jpg,Genius-level intellect. ,Recovered alcoholic.,"A youthful prodigy, Tony Stark entered MIT at a young age and graduated with top honors.  Soon afterwards, he inherited the family company, Stark Industries, following the death of his parents.  Based upon his own cutting-edge designs, the company flourished, and he quickly amassed a considerable fortune. |||| |||| While visiting a war zone (originally Vietnam, although later stories placed it in the context of the first Gulf War), Stark was wounded and captured.  Pressed into service designing weapons for the enemy, he secretly worked to design a suit of power armor, which provided him with enhanced strength while also serving to keep him alive, protecting him from the shrapnel that had lodged in his heart.  Escaping his captors, Stark makes it back to American lines, rescuing a wounded US Air Force pilot, Jim Rhodes, along the way. |||| |||| After returning to the States, Stark begins to improve his armor designs, setting up the Iron Man alter-ego as his bodyguard while he begins his career as a superhero.  A founding member of the Avengers, Stark provides much of the material and technical support for the group, concealing his dual role as a member of the group even from the others.  As time goes by, however, Stark's personal life begins to threaten his career as Iron Man.  A dependency on alcohol leads to difficulties maintaining his business interests, problems exacerbated by attacks from business rivals Justin Hammer and Obadiah Stane.  Eventually, Stane's actions lead Stark to fall deeper into alcoholism, and he actually loses his company;  at the same time, James Rhodes, now a long-time friend, takes over the role of Iron Man.  Eventually, Stark is able to regain both his corporation and fortune, along with the use of the Iron Man identity, replacing a mentally unstable Rhodes and defeating Stane in combat. |||| |||| Having sworn to leave the business of arms manufacture, Stark moves proactively against uses of his armor technology for aggressive purposes, disarming both heroes and villains, and going so far as to oppose government and law enforcement groups.  Later, following health problems, he fakes his own death and places himself in suspended animation, while Rhodes again takes the Iron Man role, this time in the armored suit known as War Machine.  Although Stark does eventually recover, his deception alienates him from Rhodes. |||| |||| Following a conflict with his own temporarily sentient armor, Stark's heart is replaced with an artificial organ, fixing many of his health problems, but leading him to require periodic charging, just as in the earliest days of his armored breastplate.  Later on, he publicly reveals his identity as Iron Man, and accepts a position as Secretary of Defense, a role he fulfills through the events leading up to the Avengers being disbanded.  In the meantime, a self-administered exposure to the techno-organic Extremis virus leads to new abilities whereby he now carries certain portions of his armor control systems within his body, allowing him to control his suit remotely and interface with other electronic information systems, as well as increasing his reaction time and own ability to heal. |||| |||| Recently, Stark heads the government project to instate the Super-human Registration Act, leading to conflicts with several of his past allies.  The pro-Registration side ultimately triumphs in this struggle, and Stark is elevated to director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and head of the Initiative Project, dedicated to creating a roster of different teams, each serving as a government-trained and -licensed superhuman police force on a state-by-state basis."

1365,Quasar (Marvel)(02 - Wendell Vaughn),Wendell Elvis Vaughn ,1365_20060723063214_char.jpg,"Quasar's powers are derived from the pair of quantum bands fused to his wrists (or more specifically, from the seven gems on each of the bands). They are linked to their wearer's nervous system and grant tremendous powers of energy manipulation. |||| |||| Foremost amongst these powers is the ability to tap into a limitless energy source called the quantum zone. Quasar can project quantum energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat, but more commonly employs them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy, such as containment spheres or pincers. He protects himself with a personal force field of quantum energy. |||| |||| The quantum bands can also exert control over many other types of energy that are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, Quasar once tapped into a sun and caused it to emit an enormous solar flare. He can also absorb and redirect the cosmic energy wielded by such powerful beings as the Silver Surfer, Jack of Hearts, Adam Warlock, Thanos, Phoenix, and the Watchers, siphoning their power and using it to augment his quantum energy. Forms of energy the quantum bands cannot control include magic and darkforce. |||| |||| Although he cannot overtly affect psionic energy, Quasar has programmed his bands to render him impervious to psionic mental control. Even Moondragon and the Overmind proved unable to overcome this defense. He does not appear to be protected from magical forms of compulsion. |||| |||| Quasar can create apertures into and out of the quantum zone, thus allowing passage through its infinite, featureless expanse. He mainly uses this ability to traverse interstellar distances in a manner similar to hyperspace travel. The effect is essentially a form of teleportation, which Quasar refers to as a quantum jump. A quantum jump has a destructive side effect on the local environment, violently upheaving gravity and tearing holes in the atmosphere (on Earth, it would damage the ozone layer), so Quasar initially refrained from using it except when in space or in dire circumstances. However, he eventually realized that he could contain this side effect by first surrounding himself with a barrier of solid energy. Quasar can also shunt other matter into the quantum zone provided that he's in physical contact with it. |||| |||| The quantum bands enable their wearer to fly by manipulating gravitons. The maximum flight speed he can attain is unknown, but he made a trip from Earth to Uranus in approximately four years flying non-stop (this was before he learned how to quantum jump). That would require a constant speed of roughly 50,000 miles per hour. This doesn't take into account the velocity he can achieve in a short burst of acceleration. |||| |||| The quantum band gems seem to be able to analyze and process information as if they were extremely advanced computers. This allows Quasar to navigate the quantum zone and the depths of space. The gems are able to detect, analyze, and track energy emissions across vast distances. They can also 'program' his quantum energy to register and react to certain preset conditions. For instance, at one time Quasar had the Earth surrounded with an invisible laticework of energy that was designed to act as a global alert system against potential extraterrestrial threats. The energy field could detect any surges of exotic energy emanating from the planet's surface as well as if any object larger than a micrometeorite passed through it; in either case, the field would react by transmitting an alert signal to the quantum bands. |||| |||| Quasar has a direct link to Epoch through his bands, which gives him ready access to her nascent omniscience. |||| [edit] |||| |||| The Star Brand |||| |||| While he possessed the power of the Star Brand, Quasar gained the abilities of flight, superhuman strength and resilience. He also was able to regenerate his entire body from minute remains and did not need to eat, drink, or breathe. However, virtually all of the energy derived from the Star Brand was depleted not long after he gave it away. The Living Tribunal later stated that Quasar's body retains only an insignificant trace amount of energy. |||| [edit] |||| |||| Cosmic awareness |||| |||| Quasar also briefly possessed the same powers of cosmic awareness that Eon granted to the origial Captain Marvel. By simply concentrating for a moment, he could gain complete knowledge about virtually anything in the universe. It's unclear why Eon didn't bestow cosmic awareness on Quasar permanently, but being nigh-omniscient himself, he likely determined that it would have been detrimental to Quasar's psyche (as it was to that of Genis-Vell). The fact that he received the awareness while his mind was inhabiting an energy construct, and he did not demonstrate it upon returning to his body, may also have something to do with it. |||| |||| From the Wikipedia entry for Quasar |||| http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar_(comics) |||| ||||",,None entered.

Thor was born centuries ago in a cave in Norway. Once Thor was weened, Odin brought him to Asgard where he was raised to be the God of Thunder and heir to the throne. As the Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor commands the thunder, the lightning the wind and all the elements of the storm with his hammer Mjolnir, which was forged from the legendary, indestructible Asgardian metal; Uru. Mjolnir gives Thor the power of flight and helps him channel, focus or amplify his own godly elemental powers. Though the hammer is quite heavy by mortal standards, It can only be lifted by those deemed worthy to do so, regardless of the would-be wielder’s physical strength. After centuries of defending Asgard from its enemies, Thor became too proud and grew headstrong. It was because of this that he was banished to Midgard (Earth) by his father to teach him some needed humility. Made mortal and given the form of the handicapped human doctor Donald Blake, Thor learned what it was like to be small and frail and how to be humble and truly noble despite being mortal. When in his mortal guise of Dr. Blake he is able to transform into his true godly form by striking his walking stick (actually Mjolnir in disguise) upon any solid surface causing the transformation that changes him into Thor and his walking stick into his hammer Mjolnir.

Due to the scientific properties of intergalactic travel, he actually found himself over 2,000 years in the future, and to his disappointment, the world's leading city was no longer Rome, but Metropolis. Nonetheless, he became the city's protector, in a world that did not feature a Superman. Already displaced thousands of years from his own time, the Centurion had a very public identity. |||| |||| Zero Hour |||| Main article: Zero Hour |||| The Alpha Centurion originally appeared during Zero Hour as a member of an alternate timeline.[1] He was the sole protector of Metropolis, operating out of what would regularly be LexCorp Tower, and even maintained a steady relationship with Lois Lane. In his timeline, the Metropolis Police Force was an alternate good version of the 100, still featuring such members as Maggie Sawyer and Jim Harper. He met Superman when the two of them teamed up in Centurion's Metropolis against Bloody Mary.[2] He also helped in the battle against Extant and Parallax, although the resulting temporal chaos erased him and his timeline from existence.[3] |||| |||| Regular Arrival |||| Eventually, Marcus Aelius showed up in the regular timeline.[4] There was initially tension between him and Superman (especially surrounding Centurion's feelings for Lois Lane), and the two of them were frequently at odds. The Alpha Centurion joined forces with the Contessa, who was at that time in charge of LexCorp while Lex Luthor was in hiding. He was put in charge of Team Luthor, which he renamed and remodeled after himself, calling them the 'Centurions'. When Superman was put on trial in front of an alien tribunal, the Centurion recruited Superboy, Supergirl, the Eradicator and Steel to rescue him. He had a brief falling out with the others, since they mistakenly believed for a time that he was the Cyborg Superman in disguise. After arriving back on Earth, he was publicly embarrassed by Lex Luthor[5] and quit Team Luthor before leaving Metropolis.[6] Alpha Centurion was last seen in Washington D.C."
