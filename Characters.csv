18511,Channon Yarrow,,18511_20080122062710_char.jpg,,,"Channon begins the series as one of the dancers at a strip club in the Angels 8 district of the city, which is invaded by Spider Jerusalem during the Transient Riots.  Inspired when Spider quells the riots by broadcasting a live bulletin about it directly to the rest of the City via The Word's feedsite, Channon (who turns out to be a journalism student doing a story on stripping) quits the club and is hired by The Word editor Mitchell Royce to be Spider's assistant, a job originally consisting primarily of making sure her boss is supplied with enough brain-enhancing drugs and alcohol to be an effective journalist."
19,Shade (DC),Richard 'Dickie' Swift,19_20120616112158_char.jpg,,,"English by birth, the Shade finds himself most at home in Opal City, a place he has come to love dearly. Over a century ago, he and a dwarf called Culp experienced something which gave them command of a mysterious shadow-substance and made them immortal. Using these abilities for mercenary purposes, the two of them often clashed across the globe for many years, until finally Culp disappeared. The Shade made a name for himself, of a sort, as a costumed villain, fighting the masked mystery men of America for no reason other than for sport. In recent years, however, he has mellowed and reformed, tending to use his powers in protection of Opal City and could even be regarded as a hero of sorts, having formed friendships with a number of super-people, not least Starman Jack Knight. He has also had a final confrontation with Culp, who had been hiding within his own body for decades. He is now pursuing the current Spider, a member of the hated Ludlow family, against whom the Shade has a long-standing grudge."

21,Dian Belmont,,21_20091206054340_char.jpg,,,"Long-time companion, but apparently never the wife, of Wesley Dodds, Dian Belmont is a celebrated author and Nobel Prize winner.  After  meeting Dodds at a ball in Adventure Comics #47, Dian soon partnered with Dodds romantically and professionally.  She was often seen as a conduit of information from her father, District Attorney Larry Belmont, to her lover, Dodds. She fully knew of Wesley Dodds' secret life as The Sandman (I), and, on at least one occasion, even wore his uniform and actively fought crime as The Sandman.  It might even be fair to technically call her The Sandman (II).  Incurring serious injuries while in the original Sandman uniform ( All-Star Squadron #18), Wesley Dodds decided soon thereafter to completely change his uniform.  She assisted with the redesign, which resulted in the purple-and-black design he would sport for most of the rest of the Golden Age. Long after their crime-fighting days were over, the couple decided to take a final trip around the world in the pages of Starman vol. 2 #30.  As they arrived in the Orient, she died of apparently natural causes."

24,Starman (DC)(03 - Mikaal Tomas),Mikaal Tomas,24_20060322064057_char.jpg,,,"Mikaal Tomas, an alien, blue-skinned warrior of Talok III, turned against his people when they were to invade the Earth in 1976. Now branded a traitor, Mikaal attempted to start a new life on Earth as Michael Thomas. He had a distinguishing but brief super-hero career as Starman, before becoming a thrill-seeking drug addict. At that time, he was kidnapped and ""traded"" to various ""keepers"". Some kept him as a collector's item, others used him for sex. Eventually, he ended up with an amusement park freak show, owned by the demon Bliss. Not long ago, he was found and freed by Starman VII, and the two of them formed a deep friendship. Recently, his ""warrior's soul"" returned to him, and prophecies say that Mikaal Tomas' (he does not call himself ""Starman"" anymore), greatest adventures lie in the future."

20,Sandman (DC)(01 - Wesley Dodds),Wesley Dodds,20_20051214051743_char.jpg,,,"Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman, was the (DC) world's first costumed super-hero--according, at least, to one interpretation of the DCU's internal chronology.  (The events of Crisis on Infinite Earths has thrown that interpretation into some doubt.  Indeed, Crisis lent seemingly irresolvable doubt to virtually every Golden Age hero's ""first appearance in the DCU timeline"" date.) In our world, though, his date of first publication slightly postdates Superman's, is roughly concurrent with Batman's, and significantly postdates the (newspaper) appearances of The Phantom, Zorro, and several other ""pulpy"" predecessors. Nevertheless, he is one of the earliest American comic superheroes--despite, like Batman, having no supernatural powers.  And certainly, in the 2005 DCU, he can safely be said to predate Superman, Batman, and most other superheroes--even if it's rather more tricky to say with authority that he's the ""original"" superhero of the DCU.  (Events of the 2005/6 Infinite Crisis may shake up the DCU's past once again, though, giving us clearer answers in the near future.) More apt to solve mysteries than perform super heroic feats, Dodds is usually accompanied by his love interest (and sometimes sidekick) Dian Belmont, as well as his usual sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy. Dodds uses the visions received in dreams to solve mysteries."

18,Starman (DC)(07 - Jack Knight),Jack Knight,1/4/18_20050925073219_char.jpg,,,"Although Ted Knight, the original Starman, was his father, Jack cared little for the world of super-heroes, preferring his career as a collectibles dealer. However, when his brother, David, was killed in action shortly after taking on the role of Starman, Jack was forced into taking up the cosmic rod in order to protect Opal City and bring his brother's killer to justice. Since then, he imperceptibly came to love his role as Opal's protector, and found that he enjoyed being a hero. Recently, he embarked on a year-long quest in space to find Will Payton, his girlfriend Sadie's brother and a former Starman. He was eventually successful in his quest, but did not bring Payton back to Earth since the latter discovered he may be the reincarnation of an alien prince. Jack agreed to be a member of the Justice Society after the mission to ensure Fate's reincarnation, but following events in Opal City which kept him away for some time, he reconsidered and become a reservist, called in when the group was in desperate need of additional firepower. Later still, following the death of his father, and Sadie's announcement that she was pregnant, he decided to step down from the heroic world altogether in order to rear his two children (the first having been sired without his knowledge when he was raped by the Mist), passing the cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, the current Star-Spangled Kid."
