3248,Electro (Marvel)(Ultimate),Dillon,3248_20070906053804_char.jpg,Electro can generate and re-channel electric energy into concussive force.,,"Dillon was a criminal who underwent illegal genetic experiments carried out by Dr. John Skrtic on behalf of industrialist Justin Hammer, who was competing with Osborn Industries to win a lucrative government contract to create a super-soldier serum. Having been successfully given electrical abilities, Electro, as he now liked to be called, was sold into the service of the Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk, in return for construction contracts for another of Hammer’s projects. Electro served Fisk willingly as an enforcer, and when Spider-Man broke into Fisk Tower, the Kingpin set his new acquisition the task of taking the intruder down, something Electro swiftly managed. Electro was subsequently present when Kingpin murdered Frederick Foswell, the underboss known as Mr. Big, for having supplied Spider-Man with information. When Spider-Man returned to the Tower a few days later to steal the surveillance footage showing Fisk’s crime, Electro and the Enforcers were sent to stop him. Initially dodging Electro’s blasts, Spider-Man then tricked his foe into stunning Ox, one of the Enforcers. After taking down the other two Enforcers, Spider-Man grappled with Electro, then threw him in to a stream of water coming from a broken water pipe, causing the electrical criminal to short out violently. He awoke three weeks later in hospital to find that the Kingpin had fled the country and F.B.I. agents waiting for him to wake so they could question him as to his reasons for being in the crime lord’s basement. Electro’s killed everyone in the room and fled, but he was swiftly recaptured by Captain America, Iron Man and the Black Widow. He was imprisoned in a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. facility alongside several other genetically modified criminals (Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Kraven and Sandman), his powers blocked by a high-tech control collar, to be studied and interrogated by Hank Pym (Giant Man). After several months, Dr Octopus engineered a break out, and the group slaughtered their way to freedom, killing 35 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on their way out. Their next move was a direct assault on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Triskelion main base to capture Spider-Man, who had been moved there for his own protection. Octopus breached computer security to shut down the base’s defenses, then Electro overloaded both primary and back-up generators. The group entered and left equally swiftly with their objective. Spider-Man was coerced into working with them on as they launched an attack on the White House itself. Conventional forces fell before them in seconds, but their progress was halted on the front lawn outside the Oval Office by the arrival of the Ultimates. Electro attacked Thor, and their battle raged into the air; but Electro’s powers proved no match for the alleged God of Lightning, who soon won the day, and along with his teammates, Electro was returned to custody. Bolivar Trask hired Electro to test Eddie Brock and the Venom suit by leading him on a chase through Manhattan. Spider-man showed up, but was knocked unconscious, resulting in a battle between Venom and Electro for the life of the web-slinger. Although Venom defeated Electro, S.H.I.E.L.D. intervened before anything more could happen. Electro was then placed back into their custody."
1449,Speedy (DC)(Post Crisis)(02 - Mia Dearden),Mia Dearden,1449_20051017044611_char.jpg,,HIV positive.,"Mia Dearden was introduced by writer Kevin Smith in Green Arrow volume 2 #2 in 2001. Mia was a teenaged girl who ran from her home after being abused by her father. Unable to survive on her own, she fell in love with a man named Richard, who offered her shelter and food in exchange for exploiting her in child prostitution. Mia is rescued from one of her clients, a depraved local politician, by Oliver Queen, who had just recently returned from the dead. Mia continued to work with Oliver, who was busy trying to reconstruct his own life, and began to train at archery under his tutelage. Mia continually petitioned Green Arrow to allow her to serve as his sidekick, but Oliver continually demurred, not wanting to put another youngster at risk. Mia continued to appear in Green Arrow as a supporting character until 2004, when writer Judd Winick revealed that Mia was HIV positive, a legacy of her unsavory past. With this knowledge, Mia redoubled her efforts to convince Green Arrow to let her become the new Speedy, and Green Arrow finally relented. In Green Arrow volume 2 #45 (2004), Mia takes up the Speedy mantle, and in the following issue (2005), she joins the Teen Titans.

Rose is the beautiful redheaded Irish girl who lived in the late 19th century and who came to live at the Howlett's mansion after the death of her parents. She was twelve years old when she first arrived and became James Howlett's constant companion. Originally, she became friends with James (Wolverine) Howlett and Dog Logan, a boy who was the son of the groundskeeper of the estate. However, as they aged, Rose and James grew apart from Dog Logan. Dog became more and more aggressive and started having sexual feelings towards Rose. After many unanswered and unwanted advances towards Rose, Dog eventually tried to rape her. The attempt failed but the two incidents caused James' father, John, to fire Dog's father, Thomas Logan. Angered by his being fired, Dog's father broke into the Howlett's property with his son and ordered Dog to keep the Howlett's under gunpoint. The scene escalates and John Howlett is killed by Dog's father. In turn, the young James kills Dog's father and severely wounds Dog. Rose, not knowing what to do, takes James away, leaving the estate. When the police arrive, Dog blames the whole thing on Rose and James. *** ON THE RUN *** After being accused of the murders in the mansion, Rose and James traveled towards James' grandfather, Old Man Howlett. He however refused to help Rose and Logan, after which the pair goes on the run again, eventually traveling to the north of Canada. Eventually they end up in a small mining community deep within Canada where they start a new life. Rose claims James is her cousin named 'Logan' and soon begin to settle in the community. Rose always had a journal by hand in which she had described the events of her life. The two remain in the camp for several years, during which Rose grows up to become a beautiful young woman. James 'Logan' Howlett feels very attracted towards her, but these romantic feelings are not mutual. Eventually, Rose falls in love with Smitty, the camp's foreman. Smitty and Rose make plans to marry and move back to the city. Much to the grief of James. During this time, a ghost from the past reveals itself. Dog Logan, their former childhood friend, had tracked the pair down to the mining community, on strict orders from Old Man Howlett who wanted to make amends with his grandson. However, Dog Logan had different ideas and soon attacked James. During the fight, Rose tries to intervene and, tragically, is stabbed and killed accidentally when she falls onto Logan's extended claws."

After earning Ra's enmity (for reasons unknown) Daark died during a plot to kidnap Talia al Ghul which was foiled by The Batman. The Sensei was put in charge of the League afterwards, however he would prove just as disloyal as his predecessor, and The Sensei would eventually struggle with Ra's al Ghul for the control of the organization. For a time, the Sensei was possessed by the spirit called Jonah, who in Sensei's body was responsible for the murder of Boston Brand, who became Deadman after his death. After a struggle with Deadman and Rama Kushna, Jonah was destroyed and the Sensei resumed control of his body. For a brief time, the Sensei assumed leadership of the League of Assassins. By this stage The Sensei was clearly insane (if he had not been before) with no goals other than to raise assassination to an artform. Among other crimes he used Bronze Tiger, the brainwashed partner of Richard Dragon, to carry out a number of assassinations. Most notably used The Bronze Tiger to occupy Batman in battle, while other assassins killed Batman's friend Kathy Kane. He next attempted to kill a number of dignitiaries by having the League plant explosives along a fault line, stating that using a force of nature to carry out an assassination would be his greatest work of art. Although Batman arrived in time to rescue the deligates, he was unable to stop the earthquake. With no time to pursue The Sensei himself, Batman was forced to allow Ra's al Ghul to go after the assassin. Sensei then engaged himself in a fight to the death with Ra's al Ghul, during which both of them were swallowed by the earthquake. Ra's lived thanks to his rejuvenating Lazarus Pit. The Sensei, however, did not survive."

Dressed in the ghoulish scarecrow costume that would later display his identity, Crane caused the main bully and his girlfriend, who had earlier rejected Crane, to have an auto accident which paralyzed the bully and killed the girlfriend. Crane then discovered a savage delight in frightening people literally to death. He became a professor of psychology at Gotham University, specializing in the psychology of fear. After his dismissal for firing a bullet at a flower pot to get his point across, he killed the people responsible for his dismissal and became a career criminal.

The Jester also had superior detective skills.",,"In 1941, during a time when, as he once put it himself, \'everyone with a gimmick was slipping into bright long johns\', rookie policeman Chuck Lane decided that fighting crime in a police uniform was not enough, and secretly became the costumed vigilante known as the Jester, partly as a way to do good, partly for the thrills of it. The gimmick was chosen mainly because Lane was said to be a direct descendent of a medieval court jester. Time and again, the Jester would make criminals into laughing-stocks, joking at their expense and often using slapstick comedy tricks to defeat them. But despite his lighthearted manner, the sound of the bells of his costume and his high-pitched, squealing laugh was dreaded by criminals, who never knew were they had their nemesis. They feared him for being so intense, so unpredictable and strange. The Jester was fairly respected in the community of mystery-men. In 1942, he became a member both of Uncle Sam's Freedom Fighters, and of the wartime All-Star Squadron, of which he was a semi-active member until the war ended in 1945. At the end of the 1940s, Charles Lane became a plainclothes Detective of the NYPD, and spent less and less time in his colorful Jester costume. The last recorded adventure of the Jester, is from 1952, when he traveled to Opal City to bring in the supervillain Bobo Benetti, who had previously robbed a factory in New York. During this time Jester got involved in a combat against the original Icicle, the original Gambler, and the Fiddler, who had joined forces to kill Ted Knight, the Golden Age Starman, make a fast crime spree in Opal, and then retire. With the help from the Shade and Benetti himself, Starman and Jester defeated the super-villains and their plans. About six months later, Starman captured Benetti, and Detective Charles Lane appeared to bring Bobo to New York, where he was charged with his crimes."

(The events of Crisis on Infinite Earths has thrown that interpretation into some doubt.  Indeed, Crisis lent seemingly irresolvable doubt to virtually every Golden Age hero's \'first appearance in the DCU timeline\' date.) In our world, though, his date of first publication slightly postdates Superman's, is roughly concurrent with Batman's, and significantly postdates the (newspaper) appearances of The Phantom, Zorro, and several other \'pulpy\' predecessors. Nevertheless, he is one of the earliest American comic superheroes--despite, like Batman, having no supernatural powers.  And certainly, in the 2005 DCU, he can safely be said to predate Superman, Batman, and most other superheroes--even if it's rather more tricky to say with authority that he's the \'original\' superhero of the DCU.  (Events of the 2005/6 Infinite Crisis may shake up the DCU's past once again, though, giving us clearer answers in the near future.) More apt to solve mysteries than perform super heroic feats, Dodds is usually accompanied by his love interest (and sometimes sidekick) Dian Belmont, as well as his usual sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy.

Kendra also has her great aunts love of archaic weaponry and is an expert at hand-to-hand combat, skilled in a number of martial arts techniques.",,"Kendra is the granddaughter of Golden Age adventurer \'Speed\' Saunders and grandniece of the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Kendra had a troubled youth spending much of her childhood in various youth facilities, following her parents death when she was sixteen. Rather than staying in the facilities, Kendra often took refuge on the streets until she was eventually found by her grandfather, Speed Saunders, who became her guardian and helped put some stability in her life and Kendra entered film school following an old dream of hers. However, her troubles were not over and at age seventeen she cut her wrists trying to commit suicide. Speed found her in the bathroom and quickly rushed her to the hospital where she died. Ten minutes after being pronounced dead she suddenly began breathing again, having somehow miraculously been brought back to life. When she opened her eyes Speed noticed that her eyes were no longer green but brown. Upon seeing this Speed realized that he was no longer looking at his granddaughter but the reincarnation of Shiera Hall and Egyptian princess Chay-Ara. Kendra still believed herself to be Kendra Saunders and believing that a reincarnation of Khufu or Carter could not be far behind Speed decided that revealing the truth to Kendra was probably not meant for him. Instead he told Kendra of her family history and began training her to take the mantle of Hawkgirl. Six months after her training began on the night of her nineteenth birthday she got a frantic phone call from her grandfather who told her to get the wings. Speed had just witnessed the death of Wesley Dodds at the hands of Mordru the Dark Lord and knew that in order to stop the Dark Lord the Justice Society would be forced to reform and he knew that Kendra's future destiny was closely tied to the JSA [JSA Secret Files #1]. The following day Kendra donned the wings of her grand aunt and took flight for the first time. As per instructions by her grandfather she then traveled to Vancouver to find and protect a newborn baby boy no matter what. The baby, who was the reincarnation of Hector Hall and heir to the mantle of Dr. Fate, was being hunted down by Mordru so that he could kill him and assume the power of Dr. Fate himself. Although Mordru was able to kidnap the baby, the JSA and Kendra eventually found him and before he was able to kill the child, and the Star-Spangled Kid managed to bond the child to the Fate power. Using his vast powers, the new Dr. Fate was able to imprison Mordru in his amulet and save the JSA. The heroes then returned to the JSA headquarters and decided to reform the JSA on a permanent basis. Kendra joined the group as Hawkgirl and has been a valuable asset to the team ever since [JSA #2-#4] When Carter Hall returned from the dead, Kendra learned that her suicide attempt at age 16 had been successful, and that the soul inhabiting her body was actually that of her great aunt, Sheira Hall, the original Hawkgirl. However, she still retains Kendra's memories and personality, finding it hard to connect to the Sheira part of her identity. When Carter Hall returned to life, she moved with him to St. Roch in Louisiana, but the two have not become lovers (unlike all their previous lives), just good friends."

13,Angel (Marvel)(03 - Warren Worthington III),Warren Kenneth Worthington III,13_20051203110123_char.jpg,"Angel has fully feathered wings that span 16' and have a very flexible skeletal structure. He can fly by flapping his wings, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph. Though he generally flies below the height of clouds at 6,500 feet, Angel can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Angel's entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. Angel is a skilled combatant, especially in aerial hand-to-hand combat. He is also a talented businessman whose wealth ranks him in the lower part of the Fortune 500 list. See the entry on Archangel for information on his secondary mutation.",,"Warren Worthington III was born in Centerport, New York to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington Jr. He was attending a private school in his adolescence when white, feathered wings began to grow from his shoulder blades. At first Warren felt he was a freak, but he soon learned that he could use his wings to fly and to help people. When there was a fire in his dormitory, he borrowed some props from the school's drama department, dressed up as a \'heavenly\' angel and rescued his friends. He soon learned that he in fact is a mutant. He donned a mask and costume and called himself the Avenging Angel and was a solo adventurer originally. He then began attending the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters, where Professor Charles Xavier trained young mutants to control their powers and use them for good. Taking the code name Angel, Worthington became one of the original members of the superhero team the X-Men. For a time, he was romantically interested in Jean Grey, but eventually he realized that Jean was in love with Scott Summers and gave up the pursuit. While pursuing Sauron in the Savage Land, Angel was attacked by Pteranodons and fell to his death. He was brought back to life by an uncostumed Magneto, who was known as Creator in the Savage Land. Presumed dead, Magneto had been gathering a mutant army. When the original X-Men were captured by the mutant island Krakoa, Professor X created a new team of X-Men to rescue them. When this new team of X-Men decided to stay, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of Cyclops, left the team. He and Iceman went to Los Angeles, where they founded the Champions with Hercules, the Black Widow, and the original Ghost Rider. Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops' subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoined the X-Men to help pick up the slack. During this time, Angel grew increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of Wolverine, and after some time quit the team in protest. He was once kidnapped by the Morlock leader Callisto and stripped of most of his clothing. Callisto attempted to humiliate him. He could not remember anything else at the time as he was unconscious. Just then, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Sprite arrived to stop Callisto, but they were also captured by the Morlocks and tied to stakes. Storm struck a deal with Callisto: a battle to the death without powers. They would duel with knives, with the winner keeping Angel and having the leadership of the Morlocks. Storm won, but spared Callisto's life. Shortly thereafter, Angel joined the Defenders. The Defenders did not last much longer with Angel, Iceman, and Beast being the sole survivors. They had decided to abandon the hero's life, but with the resurrection of Jean Grey, the five original X-Men chose to form X-Factor. During this period, Warren found himself giving Jean more emotional support than Cyclops was, who was going through intense emotional repercussions while trying to deal with the fact that Jean was still alive in conjunction with his own involvement with Madelyne Pryor (who was later revealed to be a clone of Jean). Archangel Much later, having joined his teammates as a member of X-Factor, Warren's wings were severely damaged during the Mutant Massacre by Harpoon. Cameron Hodge—whom Warren had known for years and considered a friend, yet was secretly anti-mutant—had his wings amputated. Despondent over the loss of his wings, Warren escaped the hospital and commandeered his private jet, which exploded in the air as the rest of X-Factor watched helplessly from below. It was revealed that Hodge had sabotaged Warren's ultralight airplane to create the illusion that the depressed Warren had tried to commit suicide. Before the explosion, Warren was spirited away by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. Apocalypse altered Warren's appearance, giving him blue skin, organic metal wings, and the ability to fire his metal feathers as projectiles. He also gave him the title of Death, the leader of his Horsemen. When it appeared as though Death had killed his former teammate Iceman, he overcame Apocalypse's brainwashing. Hungry for revenge, he tracked down Hodge. Hodge had kidnapped Warren's lover, Candy Southern, and killed her. Warren beheaded Hodge with his wings, seemingly killing him (it was later revealed that Hodge's head still lived in the X-Tinction Agenda crossover). Warren did not rejoin X-Factor immediately afterwards, spending some time as a loner called \'Dark Angel\' due to his state of mind following Southern's death. After the events of Inferno, he finally rejoined X-Factor, taking the name Archangel at Beast's urging. It was around this point that he became romantically involved with Charlotte Jones, a New York City Police officer who helped to rescue Warren and the rest of X-Factor from the Ravens, a cult of near-immortal psychic vampires. After rejoining the X-Men, Archangel became romantically involved with Psylocke. Warren soon traded in his \'Death\' garb for his old blue and white costume, signifying he was attempting to put his dark days behind him. After Psylocke was eviscerated by X-Men prisoner Sabretooth during an escape attempt, Warren and the X-Men tracked down and captured him, but not before he was able to badly damage Warren's metal wings. Over time, the damage to his wings spread. Eventually the metal wings shattered completely, revealing that his feathered wings had been growing back within them and broke them apart from the inside. This followed a visit from Ozymandias, who told him that he was indeed one of Apocalypse's chosen ones. Reclaiming his original codename Angel, Warren still retained his blue skin color. Having both experienced drastic changes in their lives, Psylocke and Warren found themselves growing apart, while Psylocke began showing attraction for new X-Men recruit Thunderbird. Realizing they were no longer on the same path, Warren ended their relationship, wishing her happiness in the future. Warren remained a member of one of the core X-Men teams, where he served as co-leader with Nightcrawler. In a fight with Black Tom Cassidy, Angel experienced a \'secondary mutation\'. His blood gained advanced healing properties, giving him the ability to heal quickly from wounds and allowing him to heal others when his blood is mixed with theirs. This new power \'healed\' Warren's skin from Apocalypse's alterations, turning his blue pallor back to its original shade. Warren discovered his ability to heal others when he saved the life of teammate Husk (Paige Guthrie) after she was severely injured in battle. He has since become involved in a controversial romance with Paige, who is several years his junior. It was also revealed during The Draco storyline that his blood dealt much pain to Nightcrawler. Also in the same storyline it is hinted by Azazel, Nightcrawler and Abyss's father, that Archangel may actually be related to an ancient civilization of Angel like mutants who had banished Azazel and his people from Earth into another Dimension. Apparently this is the same dimension through which Kurt a.k.a Nightcrawler passes through while teleporting. Warren and Paige took an extended leave of absence, and Archangel launched a charity called \'Mutantes Sans Frontières\' in Zanzibar, (a reference to Doctors Without Borders), where he then proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby Genosha. In \'Excalibur,\' Warren met up again with Callisto. As Paige reminded Warren of his history with Callisto, Viper attacked. Warren and Callisto then managed to defeat Viper together. In Generation M, it appeared that Angel's wings had shrunken and shriveled into a useless state following the events of House of M. However, it was revealed that Warren had managed to fake losing his mutant abilities in order to lure out The Ghoul, a deranged serial killer who uses his retained mutant powers to murder ex-mutants. Archangel joined with fellow former Champions member Hercules, along with Namora, and Amadeus Cho to attempt to calm down The Hulk in the Incredible Hulk #107. In their attempts to help save New York City from the destruction, they form a new team of superheroes, called the Renegades."

Bucky is a childhood friend who follows him on his missions as a photographer rather than as a costumed sidekick. Rogers' last mission as Captain America sends him to a Nazi stronghold on the coast of Iceland to stop a prototype hydrogen bomb created using alien technology. He causes the rocket carrying the bomb to explode and falls into the freezing Arctic Ocean. Rogers falls into a state of suspended animation until Tony Stark's deep sea exploration team pulls him out of the water 57 years later. Bucky survives the war, and, thinking that Rogers had been killed in action, marries Rogers' fiancée Gail. The Ultimate universe Captain America is more politically and morally conservative than his mainstream Marvel universe counterpart and is more prone to violent solutions, frequently using small arms and explosives. His costume is mostly the same, except that his mask lacks the traditional wings on the side of his head and his shoulders sport American star emblems. The mask was modified into a helmet as of Ultimates 2. Rogers becomes one of the first members and field commander of the superhuman team the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s answer to post-human terrorism. He tries to adjust to life in the 21st century, although he longs for older times and values, spending much time with Bucky and Gail (now senior citizens) and going to WWII veterans' reunions. Rogers wears a Kevlar uniform and carries a shield of pure adamantium. He also dates Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, the estranged wife of former team member Henry Pym. A year later, it appears that Captain America repeatedly betrays the team, and S.H.I.E.L.D. places him in custody. The Black Widow is revealed as the traitor, aiding a coalition of countries invading America. When these invaders, who call themselves The Liberators appear to have defeated all American superheroes and effectively America itself, the Wasp frees him from his cell and they join the other few heroes as a resistance. After a pitched one-on-one battle with the Liberators' leader, Rogers kills him with his own weapon. Rogers is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. In addition, his strength and recuperative abilities are remarkable, he has been shown bicep-curling 545 lb. In the Ultimate Universe, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as a result of his experiments to recreate the Super-Soldier serum. Despite the Hulk being one of the strongest characters in the Ultimate Universe, Rogers takes on the Hulk in hand-to-hand combat, knocking him down momentarily. The Ultimate Six, and several heroes and villains, are the results of trying to recreate the original formula. Rogers also defeats Henry Pym in melee combat while Pym is in his almost 60-foot tall Giant Man form, in retaliation for Pym having beaten the Wasp during a domestic dispute."

The Thanagarian criminal Byth then hired Sands to steal Hawkman and Hawkwoman's ship.

Guy always struggled with his anger and aggression and because of this demon he decided to use his career to help others with the same problem. Guy became a social caseworker and helped prison inmates. One of these inmates ended up being Hal Jordan. Hal was in the correctional facility because of an alcohol problem. This most likely resonated with Guy because of his own father. While Guy and Hal ware in prison during a huge prison riot, Guy lost his temper, and in a rage he attacked one of the inmates. Guy Gardner started out as the backup Green Lantern for Hal Jordan. He has since become one of the most prominent Green Lanterns of the Corps, despite possessing an egocentric personality. He has recently deserted his Green Power Ring in favor of the Red Ring of rage. Guy's will and rage are some of the most impressive in the entire Emotional Spectrum. Guy Gardner was originally tapped to become a Green Lantern. Eventually the ring was taken away from him. Searching for new powers brought him to the tomb of Sinestro where he gained his yellow power ring. That ring still needed to be charged with a Green Battery. So after Parallax destroyed the central battery, Guy was powerless again. Until he went in search of the Warrior Water. After drinking that water, he gained the ability to transform his body into any living weapon he could imagine. Later, he \'kinda\' died in Our Worlds At War, but eventually made his way back. During Green Lantern: Rebirth, the Warrior powers were pushed out of Guy's system, and he gained a brand new Green Lantern ring. He has now been given the title of Green Lantern Honor Guard and is not restricted to protect a single sector of space like other Green Lanterns."

388,"John 'J.' Jonah Jameson, Jr. (Marvel)",,388_20060504073417_char.jpg,,,"The step-son of an abusive veteran, Jameson began his journalism career as a paperboy, then copy boy for the Daily Bugle, formerly edited by old man Jameson, whom some presume to have been his father. A sullen and bullying student, he quit school after becoming a reporter. At twenty he uncovered police corruption by supposed department hero Sam Kenner; beaten and bombed, Jameson nonetheless exposed Kenner with the help of Bugle owner William Goodman. He became a full-time Bugle reporter, including a stint as a war correspondent, criticizing most costumed heroes as glory-seeking vigilantes upstaging the common man. Marrying his high school sweetheart Joan, Jameson rose to editor-in-chief and became renowned for supporting civil rights and opposing organized crime. When Goodman's heirs put the Bugle up for sale, Jameson tapped his last dollar and made the newspaper his own. He worked hard to support his wife and their son John, eventually becoming a millionaire member in New York's elite Century Club; although earning a reputation as a notorious miser, he supported many charities and often helped employees in true need. Still a reporter at heart, he ventured to Korea for a story but was crushed when Joan was killed by a masked gunman in his absence; this and other self-perceived failures contributed to his distrust of masked heroes and the heroic ideal. In recent years, when the superhuman performer Spider-Man became a crimefighter, Jameson vowed to expose him as a publicity-seeking scofflaw, and not even the rescue of John from a space flight disaster dissuaded him. He relied on photos from Peter Parker, not knowing he was employing Spider-Man himself. Jameson heralded the Spacemen as superior heroes, but this gambit failed when Spider-Man exposed them as criminals; support for Mysterio yielded similar results. Despite his many achievements, Jameson's harsh self-analysis weighed upon him, for his hatred of Spider-Man was motivated by fear that he was indeed the selfless hero Jameson could never be. Jameson hired Dr. Farley Stillwell to mutate investigator Mac Gargan into the Scorpion to defeat Spider-Man, but the debacle left Stillwell dead and the insane Scorpion hating Jameson. Plagued by guilt, the publisher confessed his actions to his friend Norman Osborn. Scientist Spencer Smythe soon offered Jameson the first of many Spider-Slayer robots, with which he battled Spider-Man to a standstill before the web-slinger escaped. Jameson rallied New York against the Kingpin's crime wave; abducted for his insolence, he remained defiant before being rescued by Spider-Man. Months later, Osborn, the Green Goblin, seemingly died in battle with Spider-Man; Jameson suspected Spider-Man of outright murder, hiring Luke Cage to bring the wall-crawler in, but desisted when John became the Man-Wolf. Jameson's obsession paled before concern for his son, but his own safety became an issue when he was attacked by the Grizzly, a violent wrestler he had blacklisted a decade before. Spider-Man rescued Jameson but chided him for the grudge; in response, Jameson hired Daniel Berkhart to harass Spider-Man as Mysterio's supposed ghost. When this failed, he contracted Farley Stillwell's brother Harlan to mutate a new operative, but fugitive Rick Deacon usurped the process and became the criminal Fly, killing Stillwell and becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and Jameson alike. Jameson mysteriously received photos depicting Spider-Man with the body of Peter Parker; the photos, sent by Osborn's drug-maddened son Harry, were actually of a clone. Jonah nevertheless kept them quiet but stepped up his traditional campaigns. He approached Dr. Marla Madison to construct her own Spider-Slayer but met no better success. Finally confronting Parker, whom he imagined had been slain and replaced by Spider-Man, Jameson believed his story of faked photography. His relationship with Madison turned romantic, and he proved his principles anew by denouncing the terrorists of the People's Liberation Front. The PLF responded by hiring the Hitman, but even in the face of death Jameson ridiculed his abductors, who were defeated by Spider-Man and the Punisher. Meanwhile, Smythe, whose obsession had outgrown even Jameson's, learned he was dying and resolved to take Jameson and Spider-Man with him to the grave. He mesmerized the Man-Wolf into abducting Jameson and fighting Spider-Man; Jameson believed John dead when he saw his son teleported away. Smythe suddenly shackled Jonah and Spider-Man with a bomb, dying afterward. Jameson broke down, admitting his obsession had harmed him far more than its subject, but Spider-Man deactivated the bomb, leaving Jameson devastated at his confession. Scientist Jonas Harrow targeted Jonah, driving him mad, but his tenacity challenged even Harrow, and after being rescued by Spider-Man, Jameson was soon his typically paranoid self. Months later, John resurfaced alive, barely remembering his extradimensional adventures, and Jameson was overjoyed with his son's cure. Longtime colleague Ian Fate resurfaced as a sorcerer in the company of the monstrous Man-Thing; naively expecting Jameson to help reshape the world, Fate lashed out when refused, but while Spider-Man fought the Man-Thing, Jameson calmed Fate and set him on a more peaceful path. Jameson himself returned to basics by investigating waterfront extortion, interrogating no less than the Kingpin and risking his life to uncover the perpetrators, albeit with unexpected assistance from Spider-Man. Perhaps in unconscious gratitude, Jameson's subsequent scheme to discredit Spider-Man with impostors proved half-hearted at best. The Hobgoblin, secretly Jameson's Century Club crony Roderick Kingsley, learned Osborn's secrets and tried to blackmail Jameson over the Scorpion's mutation. Spider-Man ended this scheme, but the conscience-stricken Jameson publicly revealed his guilt anyway, then married Marla Madison. Soon afterward, he hired the alleged mutant hunters X-Factor and the mercenary Wild Pack to bring in Spider-Man but, more at peace than he had been in years, he seemed content to restrict his castigations to the printed page. However, his vendetta literally took new form when the Chameleon imprisoned and impersonated him, bringing anti-Spider-Man sentiments to new heights. Inevitably rescued by Spider-Man, he found a new crisis awaiting him, for Thomas Fireheart, secretly the mercenary Puma, acquired the Bugle to build up Spider-Man's reputation. Jameson sought solace in his lifelong convictions, denigrating neo-Nazi Eric Hartmann in print; when Hartmann's forces invaded the Bugle, for once Jameson played the rescuer when he downed Hartmann before the madman could shoot the intervening Spider-Man. Fireheart eventually returned the Bugle to Jameson, but his control was wrested away by Norman Osborn, alive after all, but Jameson nonetheless investigated the mutant-hunting Operation: Zero Tolerance. Hoping to placate the publisher, the android-human Bastion offered him the outlaw X-Men's secrets, but Jameson refused, as his distaste for prejudice outweighed even his dislike of costumed heroes. The X-Men defeated Bastion, but Jameson was scarcely short of enemies when Osborn hired Daniel Berkhart, who had joined Mysterio's cousin Maguire Beck in the identity of Mad Jack, to force Jameson to sell the Bugle. Soon afterward, when Venom was ordered to put a scare into him, the madman mistook his instructions for a kill order, and even Jameson winced at the beating Spider-Man took in his defense. Jameson regained the Bugle when Osborn went mad in a mystic ritual, which also empowered teenager Mattie Franklin, who became a new Spider-Woman and was, ironically, entrusted to the care of the Jamesons. A different legacy hounded Jameson as Spencer Smythe's even madder son Alistair threatened Jameson's family before receiving his latest defeat. Berkhart and Beck, now Mysterio and Mad Jack, abducted Jameson but were outwitted by Spider-Man and Daredevil. Unencumbered by gratitude, he sought to capitalize on the revelation of Daredevil's secret identity but was undercut when reporter Ben Urich refused to participate. Jameson hired superhuman investigator Jessica Jones to break a similar story on Spider-Man, but Jones merely put his money to work for charity, making her later rescue of Mattie from drug dealers all the more biting. Even Jameson began to face his vendetta's futility, and his invective grew sparse. After fresh humiliation in a libel trial, he agreed to a new Bugle feature with a theoretically objective focus on super heroes, co-managed by Urich and Jones, but he was stunned by seeming proof that his son John had, inexplicably, been Spider-Man all along. Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man can only intensify when he inevitably learns the truth. Resigned from being a mayor in Superior Spider-Man #31."

The ring of a Blue Lantern however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect.

Originally, he could only use one power at a time and has duplicated Superman's strength, The Flash's speed, Green Lantern's power ring, and Wonder Woman's magic lasso among others. In most cases, Amazo possesses a 'default' form consisting of the powers of the first five (post-Crisis) JLA members, capable of adapting to incorporate other powers. After years of battling the JLA to a standstill, he recently \'upgraded\' by absorbing part of Hourman's Worlogog which gave him time traveling powers as well. Power Amplification: The ability to absorb others' powers and magnify them to greater levels.","Credited as being the world's first official android, Amazo was created by the immortal, evil mastermind Professor Ivo. Utilizing superior \'absorption cell\' technology, Amazo can replicate the super powers of any metahuman he encounters. And so, Amazo became one of the most dangerous menaces to originally oppose the Justice League of America. While initially programmed to serve the agenda of his creator - to find any means to prolong Ivo's immortality, Amazo had outgrown his original agenda. Taking on the Justice League of America, Amazo has several heroic enemies. For a time, he was imprisoned in an airtight chamber within The Fortress of Solitude, after challenging Superman. However, he eventually escaped that prison, and resumed his rivalry with the JLA, as well as the Justice Legion A's Hourman. A cybernetic hero from the 853rd century, Hourman's presence made Amazo resentful and bitter. But while Hourman - who later joined the new JSA, then departed to his original time period, is no longer Amazo's primary foe, Superman and the rest of the Justice League were still present to pose a continual problem for Amazo. While his programming and own sentience have displayed no intent on world conquest, Amazo exists as a monster of sorts, whose very being is a hazard to all of humanity.",None entered.

It is this version of Wonder Woman that went through the most profound changes.  She went from being a fairly bland (read: safe) version of herself that really had a lot in common with the animated Super Friends version.  She was all about super powers and kickin' ass, with just a pinch of her Amazonian legacy thrown in.  By the early-mid 70s, though, she had abandoned the uniform and powers entirely, and adopted a role much closer to a secret agent.  She studied with a martial arts expert, took a job as the proprietor of a hip clothing store, and wasn't seen for a couple of years in her Wonder Woman outfit.  This era drew criticism, though, so she regained her powers and went on a 2-year quest to be returned to active duty in the JLA.  No sooner had she endured her trials when the Wonder Woman title started telling Earth 2 Wonder Woman stories, in deference to the setting of the Wonder Woman TV show.  When the show, in its later seasons, returned to the present, the comic returned to Earth 1, and the newly-JLA-reinstated Wonder Woman. During the Crisis , Diana was thought to have been killed.  However, as the Pérez run would make clear, she hadn't been killed, but sent back in time. And this , out of all of Wonder Woman's adventures, is where it gets weird. Somehow, in a way not adequately explained, she wasn't just thrown back in time.  She was actually devolved to the day she'd been formed of clay.  In other words, the Crisis affected her in a way substantially differently than it did any other character in the DCU.  Wonder Woman II and Wonder Woman III are the same person, but neither has knowledge of the other.  We speak of \'reboots\' frequently in assessing the history of comic books, but it's never been so literally true as perhaps it was with Wonder Woman. What's unfortunate about this method of reinventing the character is that, far from making her history \'simpler\', as was the intended effect of the Crisis , it makes it much more complicated.  Had she been a part of the normal \'Crisis effect\'--that is, had she been reset precisely as the rest of the DCU--her story would've just started at whatever point the writers wanted to set. But in drawing this link between pre- and post- Crisis Diana, and in demonstrating that she actually \'devolved\' from one to the other, she confusingly becomes a \'non-surviving survivor\' of Crisis on Infinite Earths .

Nanites recently bonded to her body enable her to link with and control her Stark-designed battle armor, even producing the armor as if from thin air on mental command. The Black Widow is a master martial artist, an expert markswoman, a natural actress, an infamous seductress, and a gifted veteran spy. She carries assorted firearms and various miniaturized tools and weapons, such as communications equipment, tear gas pellets, various drugs, an electrostatic discharge weapon, spring-loaded cables and surveillance devices; her costuming has also included microscopic suction cups enabling her to cling to walls and ceilings. Her Stark-designed armor gives her tremendous superhuman strength and durability, the capacity for supersonic flight, and assorted built-in weapons such as repulsor rays, wrist-mounted machine guns and mind-impairing \'thought-scramblers\'.",,"A descendant of Russian royalty, Natalia Romanova was abandoned as a child and found by soldier Ivan Petrovich. A ballerina in her youth, she joined Russia's K.G.B. and became an elite intelligence operative, a combination of consummate skill and classified government enhancements of her natural abilities. She also became infamous as an often-wed, often-widowed heart-breaker whose husbands (beginning with test pilot turned intelligence agent Alexi Shostakov) tended to suffer \'unfortunate accidents\', a quirk which may have influenced her choice of long-term code name: the Black Widow. She eventually embarked on a lucrative freelance spy career, which culminated in her infiltration of New York City's Latverian Embassy. Manipulating the naïve young superhero Spider-Man into helping her escape Latverian security, Natasha used the information she gathered to audition successfully for the American-based international spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. She became a mainstay of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s black ops division, often partnered with Hawkeye (Clint Barton). After Hawkeye and the Widow led the successful extermination of over five hundred Chitauri extraterrestrial subversives, the duo was promoted to the ranks of the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s celebrity super-agents, with newly falsified personal backgrounds. Alongside the Ultimates, Black Widow helped save Earth from a Chitauri plot. She and teammate Iron Man (wealthy playboy genius Tony Stark) became lovers during the struggle, and later began dating seriously, despite Natasha's mutually hostile relationship with Stark's caustic butler, Edwin Jarvis. Giving Natasha the female equivalent of his Iron Man battle armor, Stark asked her to marry him and she said yes; however, the bloody massacre of Clint Barton's entire family by a secret traitor within the Ultimates cast a pall over Tony and Natalia's wedding preparations."

254,Blue Devil,Daniel Cassidy,254_20051219010959_char.jpg,"Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included Kevlar body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twenty-fold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a healing factor). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon. Originally, Blue Devil wielded a trident of his own design which included, among other things, rocket engines capable of carrying two people at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. He now carries the Trident of Lucifer, which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell.","Standard Demon weaknesses, i.e. Holy Water, Hallowed Ground","Dan Cassidy was a special effects wizard and stuntman hired to create and play the title character in the movie Blue Devil. To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered exoskeleton and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named Nebiros, Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body. Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with supervillains. Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of \'weirdness magnet\'. Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the Justice League of America. When the demon Neron took control of Hell and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached. Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends. In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process. Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon. Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil. Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous Mist. His bones were secretly recovered by the magician Faust, who eventually restored Blue Devil to have him destroy Nebiros. Cassidy then joined the Sentinels of Magic and eventually gave his life a third time fighting Hermes Trismegistus. He did not remain dead long, however, and roamed the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell."

The costume had been treated with a highly slippery water- and heat-proof silicon gel, allowing Copperhead to slide along any surface and slip out of tight spots.

The suit's helmet contained two seven-inch-long fangs which were capable of piercing human skin, and were coated in a potent neuro-toxin derived from copperhead snakes. The toxin could paralyze a person almost instantly, and death would follow within 30 minutes.

Copperhead used the travel opportunities his freelance career afforded him to pursue his hobby of collecting transistor radios.

He can cast spells using a technique learned from \'self-help books\' owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, \'I want Iron Lad to forget\') and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen. Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd (the Young Avenger Speed), and Billy. During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War. S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development on the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America had vetoed the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, \'I want you to die.\' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who take part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two incapacitated. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be sidelined to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells."

This suit heightens his senses, gives him the power of flight and the ability to travel in space without a vehicle.",,"A human archaeologist, Adam Strange wanders into a beam of light near an excavation site in South America.  Unbeknownst to him, this \'Zeta Beam\' is of alien origin, and it immediately transports him to its source:  the planet Rann.  There, he immediately meets Alanna, the woman destined to be his wife, and her father, Sardath, the man that will provide the technological toys that will turn him into the \'Defender of Rann\'.  His trips to Rann are typically of limited duration, though, because the Zeta beam works by irradiating its passengers.  Once that radiation wears off, Strange finds himself back on Earth.  The beam comes to Earth at regular intervals, however, so he can, at least, know where and when to place himself so as to return to Rann.   Stories tend to stress his status as a \'man of two worlds\', who spends the unfortunate bulk of his time on Earth--the one without his beloved Alanna. His most frequent ally has historically been the various Hawkpeople since the dawn of the Silver Age.  This perhaps unusual partnership has typically been explained by the fact that, on Earth, Hawkman and Adam Strange have practiced archeology when not superheroing.   Also, the Hawks and Adam Strange have forged a bond over the similarities of their lives as superheroes:  both are defending adopted planets. However, since 2004, DC has reworked things so as to display a relationship between the planets of Rann and Thanagar themselves--as the title Rann-Thanagar War suggests-- and it is currently uncertain what impact this inter-societal conflict will have on the interpersonal relationships of Hawkman/woman/girl and Adam Strange."

42,Fire (DC),Beatriz Bonilla DaCosta,42_20070301201450_char.jpg,"Originally Beatriz's only power, gained from a saturation by the organic energy source Pyroplasm, was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth (this accident also permanently dyed her hair green as well). The fact that this wasn't terribly spectacular (the flame wasn't even a foot long) when compared to the abilities of other Justice Leaguers, especially when contrasted against Fire's bold and aggressive personality, was a minor running gag in early JLI stories. However the character proved popular and eventually earned an upgrade; during the Invasion cross-over event, the alien Dominators set off a \'metagene bomb\' in the upper atmosphere which affected all super-powered DC characters and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after-effect. The \'new\' Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green flame, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts, similar to the Human Torch. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often \'flamed on\' involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts. Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and something of a natural seductress (or at least she's aware that her physical appearance grants her some degree of easy influence over others). Somewhat less frequently, she is shown to have a marketable fashion sense (having at times worked as a designer) and to have some resistance to mind control due to the fact that, as a native speaker of Portuguese, her mind is resistant to instructions given in English.",,"An operative for the Brazilian government who was caught in a massive explosion which triggered her metagene, turning her hair green and giving her the ability to breathe green fire from her mouth. Calling herself Green Flame she joined the international hero group the Global Guardians on behalf of her country. When this group dissolved, she and her friend Ice Maiden moved to the Justice League, where they soon distinguished themselves. During a massive alien invasion of Earth, Bea's powers were changed - after recovering from a flu-like affliction, she discovered she could transform her entire body into a green flame-like substance, flying along with it. She served with the League for many years, but now bases herself in Brazil, where she is a media celebrity as well as a hero. As depicted in The OMAC Project #4, it seems that after the dissolution of the Super Buddies Fire had returned to her work as detective and secret agent. In that role she helped Booster Gold and Guy Gardner to find the connection between Maxwell Lord and Blue Beetle's death. She then took part in an assault by her former teammates from Justice League International and the Super Buddies against a group of OMACs. Badly wounded, she was saved by the sacrifice of Rocket Red. Guy Gardner and Booster Gold took her to a hospital. After recovering, Fire appears in The OMAC Project Special, as an agent of Amanda Waller. One Year Later, she has become the Black King's Knight in the new ongoing Checkmate series. In the first issue of the series, Fire displays a notable change in her character as she is now depicted as an assassin and killer, a follow-up to the implication made by Amanda Waller in the OMAC Project Special that not only did she perform such duties during her secret agent days, but that she enjoyed killing. In issue 2 of Checkmate, however, it is indicated that Fire, while she will follow orders to kill, regrets taking part in a Checkmate mission in which as many as 50 Kobra personnel were killed, many immolated by Fire herself."

This spree went through Central and Keystone City and caught the eye of police officers Fred Chyre and Joe Jackam. They later tracked Amar down with help from Barry Allen (Flash II). Part of Amar's psychosis was the inability to stop himself from blurting out his crimes. Because of these outbursts, he was quickly convicted and sentenced to death. It was soon discovered that Amar's blood was so abnormal that lethal injection could not kill him. While incarcerated in Iron Heights prison, Amar cut out his own tongue and sewed his mouth shut so he would be unable to incriminate himself ever again. Wearing a thin mask of his own design, Amar became known as Murmur. While in prison, Murmur was supplied with the anthrax virus that began killing the guards and prisoners and escaped during the riots it had caused. He then joined Blacksmith, who supplied him with the anthrax, and her Rogues. Afterward, Murmur struck out on his own."

If it can be said that John Byrne's revamp of Superman in 1986 has largely been recanted by 2005, his new spin on Luthor has been celebrated and emphasized by subsequent writers.  The \'new\' Lex Luthor is a multi-layered threat to the Man of Steel, and, indeed, the whole of the DCU.  It is probably no exaggeration to say that Lex Luthor--having now been head of the DCU's single most powerful corporation, leader of several crime syndicates, and President of the United States--has appeared in or influenced events in just about every super hero title that DC has put out since 1986. This version of the character is quite unlike the previous version in that (arguably until 2004) very few ordinary people in the DCU had any notion that he was evil.  Indeed, he was able to portray himself as a friend of the people,  get elected, have generally high approval ratings, and even convince Clark Kent's boyhood pal, Pete Ross, to become his Vice President."

Komand'r is also a highly trained warrior possessing a variety of combat skills.",,"Komand'r was born the eldest child of Tamaran's royal family. The first princess born in over a hundred years, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born the Citadel Empire attacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr and killed three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened Komand'r was for all time inextricably linked with the terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r was crippled by a childhood illness that left her unable to absorb ultraviolet radiation to fly as most Tamaraneans did. Because of Komand'r's naturally grim disposition, a stark contrast to the royal family's generally contented outlook, the subjects of Tamaran hated her. As a result, though first in the line of succession, she was denied her birthright to be the next Princess of Tamaran to maintain respect and prestige of the royal family. Her privileges, honors, and her royal style and dignity were transferred to her younger sister, Princess Koriand'r (who would later become known as Starfire). Inwardly, Komand'r's rage grew and her resentment turned to hatred for her planet, her people, her family, and lastly her younger sister who, in Komand'r's eyes, made the fateful mistake of being born. Komand'r's rivalry continued and intensified when she and her siblings were sent, per Tamaran's warlike custom, for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Komand'r's true feeling were exposed, when during a sparring exercise she attempted to kill her sister, the Princess Koriand'r. As a result, she was expelled by the Warlords. Humiliated by her own transgression Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to become a warrior fighting against the forces of her own planet and, ultimately, her own family. Betrayal Komand'r later betrayed her planet with detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. Komand'r was her sister's master and made the most of her younger sister's bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When Kory killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but not before the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions. Psions, largely a species of sadistic scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranian bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, Komand'r's forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her and while the Psions were distracted, Kory broke free with the starbolts, destructive blasts of solar energy, which were a result of the experimentation. Against her better judgment she decided to free Komand'r, who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister down with the same (but more intensified), power and had her restrained for later execution. Kory escaped and stole a space ship to planet Earth, where she met a young group of heroes and helped form the new Teen Titans. Infinite Crisis and aftermath Komand'r recently appeared in the Rann-Thanagar War limited series, during which she killed Hawkwoman in her pursuit of a New Tamaran. She formed an uneasy alliance with the surviving players of the War, in order to deal with more pressing concerns (Infinite Crisis). She was not seen during the Crisis itself, and has recently appeared in Hawkgirl and JSA Classified, attempting to kill Hawkman and Hawkgirl. The Hawks defeated Komand'r, after which Hawkman used Psion technology to strip the villain of her starbolt powers."

Roman's parents were less concerned about their son's well-being and more concerned about covering up the entire incident out of fear of how their wealthy friends would react to the news of their son's injury. A second incident occurred when he was a child. While at the Sinois family country estate he was attacked by a rabid raccoon. This incident was also covered up by the Sionis family, with Roman being forbidden from mentioning it to anyone. Further adding to the cauldron was his father's \'friendship\' with Thomas Wayne; both of Roman's parents disliked the Waynes and were quite vocal about it in private with their son. However, to their son's dismay, they continued to associate with Thomas and Martha Wayne and pretended to be friends with the couple, to the extent of literally forcing him to become friends with their son, Bruce. His parents' hypocrisy had a deep impact on him, and he grew to hate and resent them and the \'masks\' they wore in public. When he graduated high school, Sionis was given a high ranking position inside his fathers company, Janus Cosmetics. It was there that he met and fell in love with Circe, a young working class secretary. His parents didn't approve of the relationship and made it clear that they wanted the romance ended. Enraged, Roman burned down the family's mansion, killing both of his parents. Upon their deaths he inherited the family fortune and business. As Roman wasn't the businessman his father was he ended up ruining Janus Cosmetics by funding a line of face-paint make-up which failed. In desperation he threw large sums of money at the staff chemists to create a product to save the company, and what came back to him was a kind of water-proof make up. The product was rushed to market without proper testing, and once it hit the market turned out to be a deadly toxin which disfigured several hundred women. Circe, now Sionis' fiancé, broke up with him in front of his entire staff. At that time, now successful mogul Bruce Wayne offered to bail out the company on the condition that Sionis give up control and allow Wayne to appoint his own Board of Directors. Sionis agreed, but was furious at the perceived humiliation and dramatic loss of face he had suffered. He went to the family mausoleum and broke his mother's ebony coffin lid and carved a mask from a large chunk of it, becoming Black Mask as he had always been obsessed with masks, and the idea that a person becomes someone else when they wear one. Sionis found he had an amazing aptitude for crime, and he soon had a large gang working for him. Calling them the False Face Society, the one requirement was that all members must select a mask from his collection and wear it at all times when on the job and in his presence. They were successfully gaining power in the Gotham underworld, until Black Mask decided it was time to take his revenge on Bruce Wayne. He began kidnapping Wayne Enterprise executives, putting masks on their faces that were coated in the deadly make-up once made by Janus Cosmetics. He also targeted Circe and forcibly disfigured her with the chemicals in order to force her to reunite with him. Circe would ultimately kill herself, leading Black Mask to replace her with a mannequin that he talked to as if it were a real person. These kidnappings drew Batman's attention, and he began hunting down the False Facers. He slowly began to dismantle the organization until he finally found Black Mask in the ruins of the Sionis Family home. Black Mask lit the wreckage on fire trying to escape, but was caught in the burning house. Batman was able to save him, but the mask had been burned onto his face and left him disfigured. Black Mask spent some time in Arkham Asylum, but escaped when Bane assaulted the facility in Knightfall and subsequently restarted the False Facers. He took on a new second-in-command, called Tattoo (whose face was covered in a tattoo mask pattern), and he began burning down Wayne properties. This time he also kidnapped Lucius Fox, CEO of Waynetech and friend of Bruce Wayne. Batman infiltrated the gang and was able to save Fox from Black Mask's torture, and even brought in Tattoo, but Black Mask escaped. Some time later, Black Mask reappeared as a mob-boss/cult figure who had given up his vendetta against Bruce Wayne. Making allegiance with the Penguin at some times, working alone at others, he controlled much of Gotham's underworld until the city was destroyed by an earthquake and declared by the government to be a \'No Man's Land.\' Sionis discarded the ebony mask, believing his scars to be a sign of his strength and determination to survive. By now completely insane, he led a cult whose trademark was ritual scarring, killing anyone who refused to join. He led a powerful group until Batman and Huntress dissolved it. Sionis was imprisoned in Blackgate Penitentiary, but he managed to escape before the city was made a part of the country again. Black Mask had lost much of his power base, and it took him some time to rebuild his empire. He began a drug trafficking ring and decided to move his organization into Gotham's East End, drawing the attention of Catwoman, who had sworn to protect that area of the city. Catwoman interfered in Black Mask's plans, stealing money from him and giving it to the poor, and injuring many of his men. Black Mask decided he wanted to remove the problem, and so found an old friend of Selina Kyle's, Sylvia Sinclair, who was working in the Gotham mobs. She revealed Catwoman's secret identity to him, and he began a campaign of terror against her. He blew up the new youth center she had endowed with the stolen money, hounded her, and kidnapped her sister and brother-in-law. Black Mask tortured Catwoman's brother-in-law brutally in front of her sister, and then made the woman eat pieces of her husband's corpse. Catwoman arrived to find her brother-in-law dead, her sister insane, and her friend Holly on the verge of being tortured. She attacked Black Mask, and the two of them fought across his penthouse. At the end of the battle, Black Mask fell from the top of the building, leaving everyone to assume he was dead. When Tim Drake quit his role as Robin in order to honor a promise to his father, Batman chose Stephanie Brown, aka Spoiler, to replace him. Batman quickly discovered that her lack of focus and self-absorption made her a danger to herself and others, and fired her. Desperate to prove herself, she took one of Batman's contingency plans and set it into action with the intent of shepherding it to a successful conclusion. The plan was to get all of Gotham's crime lords under the control of Orpheus, an agent of Batman, and therefore under the control of Batman himself. The plan failed because Spoiler was unaware that a key contact with the crime lords, Matches Malone, was actually another alter ego of Batman himself. When \'Matches Malone\' did not appear as expected, the tension at the meeting accidentally degenerated into a firefight, leaving many dead and wounded. This created a power vacuum that quickly erupted into a brutal gang war on the streets of Gotham. Desperate to rectify the situation, Spoiler sought Orpheus, believing that if she could enlist his help there might still be a chance to bring the plan to some sort of successful conclusion. As she finished telling Orpheus his role in the plan, Black Mask murdered him by slitting his throat in front of Spoiler. He then tortured Spoiler for the rest of information on the plan. Black Mask assumed Orpheus' identity, using face putty and padding, (as seen in 'Batman: War Games, Act 2') managing to fool even Batman and Onyx. As Orpheus he fanned the flames of the crisis, driving Gotham's criminal element into a bloodthirsty, destructive mob seeking to kill any member or associate of the Batman Family. He then returned to torture Spoiler for his own enjoyment only to find that she had escaped. Black Mask soon tracked her down again and they fought. Spoiler managed to overcome Black Mask and get away, but was left with severe internal injuries. Black Mask then infiltrated Oracle's Clocktower in an attempt to expose her to the criminal mob. Batman attacked him in a blind rage and Oracle, fearful for Batman's life, was forced to activate a self-destruct device in the tower to get Batman to save her. In the end, the Spoiler died due to the injuries inflicted on her and the willful negligence of Leslie Thompkins. (Although a recent retcon states that Black Mask \'tortured and killed\' Stephanie Brown in current continuity.) Black Mask then rose to become the overlord of the Gotham underworld. Allied with reporter Arturo Rodriguez, Black Mask began a campaign to discredit Batman. While Rodriguez slammed Batman in the press, Black Mask committed a series of murders disguised as Batman. This plan was complicated by the arrival of the Joker. Black Mask was intent on killing the Clown Prince of Crime and framing Batman for it, but the Joker wanted to kill Black Mask, because he robbed him of the opportunity to kill another Robin. The two nearly killed each other before Batman intervened. Batman eventually exposed Rodriguez and finally managed to capture Black Mask. However, while being taken to jail, he managed to kill the escorting officer and escape again. The assassin Deathstroke later approached Black Mask offering him a place within The Society. Eager to strengthen his increasingly tenuous grip on the underworld (Batman and the new Red Hood had both been targeting his operations), he accepted, and Captain Nazi, one of the Hyenas, and Count Vertigo were sent after Batman and Red Hood. However, these villains were defeated, and Batman ultimately prevented the Society from securing a foothold in Gotham. In an attempt to \'improve himself\' after this debacle, Black Mask threatened the most important people in Catwoman's life, from Slam Bradley to Holly Robinson. Still thinking that she adhered to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask was caught by surprise when Catwoman retaliated by shooting him in the head and blowing off his jaw, killing him. After the shooting, Selina Kyle passed the mantle of Catwoman to her friend Holly. Not long after, Holly was arrested for the killing of Black Mask."

1083,Black Alice (DC),Lori Zechlin,1083_20070222204734_char.jpg,"* Black Alice has the ability to temporarily usurp the magical powers of any being, even ones as powerful as the Spectre, gaining all its skills and power and leaving it powerless in turn. The limit to the distance at which she can steal power of a target being is unknown, but potentially limitless as she borrowed Alan Scott's abilities during the prison breakouts while he was in space. * When she steals a being's power, her clothing partially transforms to somewhat resemble that of her target. * She has even shown the ability to steal the powers of two beings simultaneously. * In the \'Helmet of Fate\' miniseries, she takes the powers of two heroes of her choice while in school and exudes magical abilities of her own.","* Her only limit is that in order to choose a particular target she must be able to see him/her; otherwise, she receives a random magic-user's powers whenever she activates her ability.","Lori Zechlin is a goth teen who lives with her father and drug addict mother. Neither Lori nor her father suspects Mrs. Zechlin's addiction because she abuses stolen prescription pharmaceuticals supplied by local drug dealers. One day, overwhelmed by shame, Mrs. Zechlin commits suicide by overdosing and drowning herself in her pool. Lori discovers the body when she comes home from school. Lori also discovers, later that same night, that she has a mystical ability – she could \'borrow\' the magical powers of other superheroes or supervillains. She did not have the same control over the powers as their owners and had little control over when she could take them or how long she could use them. Despite this, Lori (taking the name Black Alice) formulates a plan to avenge her mother's death and punish the prescription drug traffickers whom she saw as above the law. Lori's father, shattered and slipping into depression, becomes a recluse. He tries to pretend for Lori's sake that nothing was wrong. Her mother's death also distressed Lori, but she was aware of the change in her father and assigned herself the role of caregiver. Her grades began to slip, and she became alienated from her peers. Her primary social group, a Wiccan circle, expelled her because she was emitting \'black energy\' after her mother's death (in actuality, the circle's leader – her best friend, Dawn – was jealous of Lori's real and growing powers). Having recently left Gotham City following the destruction of their clock tower headquarters, the super-hero team the Birds of Prey are traveling the country by jet in order to identify and help previously unknown metahumans. Oracle had become aware of Lori's power, but not her specific abilities. She sends Huntress, disguised as a school teacher, to keep an eye on Lori and offer counseling, while Black Canary was tasked with keeping surveillance on all of Lori's activities. The goal was to determine the specific nature and strength of Lori's powers. While Black Canary watches, Lori abruptly left her boyfriend, Kyle, when Doctor Fate's powers manifest. She decides to use it before its subsidence, and seeks out a trio of suspected drug dealers. When Lori seemed intent to use lethal force, Black Canary intervenes to save the lives of the three men. Doctor Fate's power fades, and Lori flees the scene, tailed by Black Canary. Suddenly manifesting Zatanna's powers, Lori waylaid Canary and escapes. Black Canary and Huntress unite to tail Kyle in the hopes of rediscovering Lori, and instead found that Kyle is two-timing Lori with Dawn. Lori discovers the same thing shortly afterwards and prepared to destroy a shopping mall (having now manifested the powers of Black Adam) in her efforts to avenge herself on Kyle. Black Canary is able to bring her down in an all-out brawl, but it was Huntress who brings a stop to Lori's rampage by presenting a contrite Dawn. Oracle turns Lori over to the care of the real Doctor Fate, where she would receive guidance in the use of her powers."
480,Talia al Ghul (DC),,480_20051203103259_char.jpg,,,"Talia was the younger daughter of Ra's al Ghul, considered heir to his empire despite her independent streak. She entered Batman's life when he rescued her from Dr. Ebenezer Darkk, who had recently split from Ra's League of Assassins. After her rescue, she shot and killed the man who had affronted her father. Batman's arrival caught her attention, and after telling the Demon's Head of this heroic figure, began a relationship that mixed passion with betrayal, love with deceit, and left the Dark Knight with a son. The entire Dr. Darkk incident was considered a test for Batman, gauging his suitability to assume control of the league and run Ra's operation. Ra's had Robin kidnapped, then introduced himself to Batman in the Batcave, noting that his own daughter was kidnapped in the same way. Batman's investigation and rescue of the pair convinced Ra's that Batman was a suitable heir, but the Dark Knight rejected the offer of Talia and Ra's business. From the beginning, Talia found herself drawn to Batman despite their differing views of the world. His outright rejection of her father's offer, and subsequent efforts to dismantle the league, only seemed to encourage her own independence. When Batman and Ra's dueled in the desert, he was struck by a scorpion; as he lay dying under the blazing sun, she slipped him the antidote. Little has been recorded about her early years or even who her mother was. She was clearly well educated in the arts and sciences in addition to being trained in weaponry and martial arts. She never knew her older half sister, Nyssa Raatko, and seemed to have been raised in isolation, under a's watchful eye. Her mother, of mixed Asian and Arabic descent, met the Demon's Head at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. One account indicated that the woman's name was Melisande, and that she was killed by one of Ra's servants, Qayin. Another account left the woman nameless and said she died from a drug overdose. Over the next several years Talia would turn up in Batman's life as ally or opponent, as the situation dictated. He continued to acknowledge but resist the attraction between them. At one point Ra's ga sed Batman, and when he awoke the Dark Knight discovered that Ra's had performed a marriage ceremony for him and Talia. The marriage remained unconsummated at that point: The Caped Crusader escaped and refused to acknowledge the bond. At some later point they did finally admit their attraction and love, which resulted in another ceremony, followed by the birth of their son, Damian. However, he continued to reject Talia so Ra's had her betrothed, instead, to Bane. She rejected the international brute, and after Batman defeated him, Ra's agreed that he was unworthy of his \'only\' daughter. Talia remained affectionate toward her \'detective\' but gave up on thoughts of a life together. Instead, she changed her focus toward charting her own destiny. She abandoned her father and, using the name Talia Head, accepted Lex Luthor's offer to run LexCorp when he took office as president of the United States. To seal the deal, she provided Lex with a disk containing details of her father's operations. Once she took over the conglomerate, Talia fed incriminating information about Luthor's operations to Superman and Batman, which helped lead to the president's downfall. She then sold off parts of the company to Wayne Enterprises. Talia returned to the family business when she was befriended by Nyssa, who proved to be her considerably older half sister, preserved, like their father, by the Lazarus Pits. Nyssa tortured Talia, killing and resurrecting her, using the moments of madness provided by a pit to turn Talia into her agent. In time, Talia located her fat er and finally killed him. Nyssa and Talia then assumed control of the League of Assassins. The changes hardened Talia's attitude toward Batman; she now opposed him more than allying herself with the Dark Knight. Additionally, after Batgirl killed Nyssa, Talia took control of the league, setting herself up as one of the most dangerous people on Earth. The five-foot-eight woman used her newfound position of Demon's Head to become a founding member of Lex Luthor's Society, a band of super villains dedicated to wiping out the planet's super heroes. She toured the world, recruiting members, punishing those who refused membership, and opposing the heroes whenever they turned up. After the events known as Infinite Crisis, Talia began her own schemes, which included obtaining Kirk Langstrom's Man-Bat formula and creating an army of man-bats. She intended to obtain weapons of mass destruction from the British military, sending her son Damian to distract Batman. In the end, Batman stopped the plan as Damian chose his mother over his father, and the pair seemingly died in an explosion. However, they survived the explosion, although her son was injured and required a transplant of his major organs."

203,Iron Man (Marvel)(01 - Tony Stark),Anthony Edward 'Tony' Stark,203_20080930102826_char.jpg,Genius-level intellect.,Recovered alcoholic.,"A youthful prodigy, Tony Stark entered MIT at a young age and graduated with top honors.  Soon afterwards, he inherited the family company, Stark Industries, following the death of his parents.  Based upon his own cutting-edge designs, the company flourished, and he quickly amassed a considerable fortune. While visiting a war zone (originally Vietnam, although later stories placed it in the context of the first Gulf War), Stark was wounded and captured.  Pressed into service designing weapons for the enemy, he secretly worked to design a suit of power armor, which provided him with enhanced strength while also serving to keep him alive, protecting him from the shrapnel that had lodged in his heart.  Escaping his captors, Stark makes it back to American lines, rescuing a wounded US Air Force pilot, Jim Rhodes, along the way. After returning to the States, Stark begins to improve his armor designs, setting up the Iron Man alter-ego as his bodyguard while he begins his career as a superhero.  A founding member of the Avengers, Stark provides much of the material and technical support for the group, concealing his dual role as a member of the group even from the others.  As time goes by, however, Stark's personal life begins to threaten his career as Iron Man.  A dependency on alcohol leads to difficulties maintaining his business interests, problems exacerbated by attacks from business rivals Justin Hammer and Obadiah Stane.  Eventually, Stane's actions lead Stark to fall deeper into alcoholism, and he actually loses his company;  at the same time, James Rhodes, now a long-time friend, takes over the role of Iron Man.  Eventually, Stark is able to regain both his corporation and fortune, along with the use of the Iron Man identity, replacing a mentally unstable Rhodes and defeating Stane in combat. Having sworn to leave the business of arms manufacture, Stark moves proactively against uses of his armor technology for aggressive purposes, disarming both heroes and villains, and going so far as to oppose government and law enforcement groups.  Later, following health problems, he fakes his own death and places himself in suspended animation, while Rhodes again takes the Iron Man role, this time in the armored suit known as War Machine.  Although Stark does eventually recover, his deception alienates him from Rhodes. Following a conflict with his own temporarily sentient armor, Stark's heart is replaced with an artificial organ, fixing many of his health problems, but leading him to require periodic charging, just as in the earliest days of his armored breastplate.  Later on, he publicly reveals his identity as Iron Man, and accepts a position as Secretary of Defense, a role he fulfills through the events leading up to the Avengers being disbanded.  In the meantime, a self-administered exposure to the techno-organic Extremis virus leads to new abilities whereby he now carries certain portions of his armor control systems within his body, allowing him to control his suit remotely and interface with other electronic information systems, as well as increasing his reaction time and own ability to heal. Recently, Stark heads the government project to instate the Super-human Registration Act, leading to conflicts with several of his past allies.  The pro-Registration side ultimately triumphs in this struggle, and Stark is elevated to director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and head of the Initiative Project, dedicated to creating a roster of different teams, each serving as a government-trained and -licensed superhuman police force on a state-by-state basis."

3256,Giant-Man (Marvel)(Ultimate)(01 - Hank Pym),Henry Pym,3256_20080709133244_char.jpg,Giant Man can grow into many times his normal size.,,"In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Henry \'Hank\' Pym is a brilliant, but mentally fragile scientist who takes Prozac and is married to Janet Pym, née van Dyne. He is chosen to work on the \'Super Soldier Project\' for S.H.I.E.L.D. under Nick Fury. Hank is also the superhero \'Giant-Man\', able to grow to 59 feet and 11 inches (60 feet being the point where the human body cannot support its own mass). He gains his powers after experimenting on the blood of his wife Jan, who is a mutant. In this continuity, he is prone to domestic violence, a spin off of a storyline in traditional Marvel continuity. He has been attempting to change, going on a medication, and Jan believes that joining the Ultimates could be a new start for them. But the tensions of losing and humiliating himself in a battle with the Hulk, and his jealousy of Jan's \'friendship\' with Captain America, lead to a heated argument between the couple that ends after they have a violent fight, and Janet is hospitalized. Captain America himself takes revenge, beats him to a pulp despite the fact that Pym was giant-sized at the time, and forces him out of the team. He is eventually allowed back into the Triskelion, but not as a member of the Ultimates; instead, he serves with the staff and acts as a psychiatrist for inmates, including Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, Maxwell Dillon, Flint Marko and Sergei Kravinoff. Henry seems to overcome his violent streak and becomes desperate to get in the Ultimates again, becoming the ant-manipulator \'Ant-Man\' and building two prototype androids, Ultron and Vision II. Despite this, he remains a pariah, becoming increasingly depressed as S.H.I.E.L.D. debuted an entire team of Giant-Men who are capable of breaking the 60-foot \'limit\' that he had been unable to overcome and making Hank's place obsolete. Desperate, he joins the vigilante team Defenders, starting a meaningless affair with Valkyrie and making a laughing stock of himself. In spite of his sad descent, he is able to relate to his estranged wife Jan again, and the two begin to see each other again (though their renewed relationship has been platonic so far). On a side note, he is visited by the traitor within the Ultimates — an object of great fan speculation, as of 2005 — but seems too much in a funk to seriously care (It is revealed in Ultimates 2 #9 that the traitor was Ultimate Black Widow). In recently published materials, it has been revealed that Pym is building an army of Ultrons for the invading Coalition. Hank Pym keeps the American populace in line using the Ultron robots he created, not knowing how full scale the attack will prove to be. As the tide of the battle starts to turn to the Ultimates favor, Hank orders the Ultron robots to help The Ultimates and they start taking out The Liberators armed guards. He swears to Quicksilver that he planned on infiltrating The Liberators from the start. Although he appears to be lying, at some point earlier he did give the Wasp a growth serum. Interestingly, when she uses it, she grows taller than Giant-Man ever did, to nearly the same size as the S.H.I.E.L.D. Giant-Men. Apparently Pym finally overcame the 60-foot limit that plagued him earlier in the series. As the Liberators are killed or arrested, Pym once again tries to convince the Ultimates he was on their side the entire time, but Captain America and even Thor don't want to hear it. As the series comes to a close, Jan visits him in the cell Thor and Hulk had occupied eariler, quipping \'So, do we all have spend a little time in these cells?\' It has been suggested that this version of Hank suffers from bipolar disorder, which would explain his mood swings between manic/creative highs and depressive/violent lows. His use of Prozac seems to bear this out, as this drug is often prescribed to sufferers."

She's also in possession of the \'canary cry\', an ultrasonic blast of great power.",Older men.,"The current holder of the Black Canary mantle. Daughter of Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary. Dinah Lance was born into a family of crime fighters; her mother was a vigilante and her father is a cop. She grew up with the company of heroes, and after years of training, followed in her parent's footsteps by assuming the costume, identity and legacy of her mother Dinah Drake, the Black Canary. Post-Crisis she is the only one of the two Canaries to have had a relationship with Oliver Queen (the Green Arrow) - one that started when she was maybe 20 and he about 35. She was a founding member of the JLA and the Birds of Prey. Also, her mother, Dinah Drake Lance (Black Canary - 01) is dead. Pre-Crisis her history is a good deal more complicated. She's still the daughter of Black Canary (01), but she spent much of her formative years in the Thunderbolt's dimension.  Apparently, her sonic cry, as a baby, was so uncontrolled, that the only solution was to remove her entirely from the \'real\' plane of existence.  While in this other dimension, though, she was kept maturing in a state of suspended animation. In order to keep the parents from worrying about their child, Johnny's Thunderbolt removed all knowledge from them that they had done any of this. They returned to Earth-2 believing that their child had died.  Years later, after Dinah Drake Lance had moved to Earth-1 when her husband died, Black Canary (01) became exposed to radiation that was killing her. Not knowing how to save her, Superman learned of Thunderbolt's earlier deception. Together, they decided to transfer Black Canary (01)'s life essence into the body of her daughter.  They also intrigued to keep this act of transference from Dinah once the process was complete. Thus, Black Canary (01) literally became her daughter. Green Arrow was similarly kept in the dark, though one wonders how he couldn't have noticed the difference between the two bodies in more \'intimate\' moments. Perhaps he didn't have time to notice before the Crisis hit a short time thereafter."

Unfortunately, Kenneth was killed by a blow to the back of his head by Thomas Logan when he and his son tried to rob the Howlett estate."
68,Magneto (Marvel),Erik 'Max' Magnus Eisenhardt/Lehnsherr,68_20051111055713_char.jpg,"Magneto possesses the power to control all forms of magnetism. He can shape and manipulate magnetic fields that exist naturally or artificially. It is unclear, however, whether he must draw magnetic force from outside himself (if so, then he can do so over vast distances), or whether he can also generate magnetic force from within himself. Nor is it clear whether Magneto's power is psionic or purely physiological in nature. Magneto's power is, for all practical purposes, limitless. Moreover, he can use his magnetic powers in more than one way simultaneously. He can completely assemble a complicated machine within seconds through his powers. He can erect magnetic force fields with a high degree of impenetrability around himself for protection. Although Magneto's primary power is control over magnetism, he can also project or manipulate any form of energy that is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism, since it's more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. Magneto has also exhibited powers of astral projection and telepathy, and has claimed to be able to control the minds of others, though his abilities along these lines appear to be minimal. Magneto's ability to wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical condition. When severely injured, his body is unable to withstand the strain of manipulating great amounts of magnetic forces",,"After witnessing the brutal murder of his family by the Nazis, the man known as Magnus was sent to the Auschwitz death camp where he served in the Sonderkommando, the squad of Jewish men forced to helped their Nazi masters operate the gas chambers, ovens, and fire pits of the camp. While in Auschwitz, Magnus met a gypsy girl named Magda. Magnus and Magda survived the Holocaust, and later were married. They had a daughter, Anya. Magnus first consciously used his mutant powers when his family was trapped in a burning house. Unable to rescue his daughter from the blaze due to his inexperience, coupled with interference from a mob of angry humans, he angrily unleashed his powers to vengefully slaughter the humans. Terrified, Magda left him, and months later discovered that she was pregnant. Magda presumably died after giving birth to mutant twins at Wundagore Mountain. To shake off his pursuers, Magnus had master forger George Odekirk create the identity of Sinte gypsy \'Erik Lehnsherr\' for him. Magnus eventually made his way to Israel where he worked as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital near Haifa. He befriended Charles Xavier, with whom he shared lengthy debates, hypothesizing what would happen if humanity were to be faced with a race of super-powered beings. The pair ultimately revealed their true natures to each other when they prevented Nazi war criminal Baron Wolfgang von Strucker from obtaining a large cache of Nazi gold. Causing a cave-in that seemingly killed Strucker, Magnus realized that his and Xavier's views on mutant/human relations were incompatible and left with the gold. Fearing another Holocaust, he took an aggressive and lethal stance against humanity. Magnus has often expressed the belief that mutants, whom he calls Homo-sapien-superior, will eventually be the dominant life form on the planet, and has wavered between wanting to exist in harmony with humans, wanting a separate homeland for mutants, and wanting to enforce his superiority over all humanity. Calling himself Magneto, Magnus banded together a group he dubbed the Brotherhood of Mutants, later referred to as \'Evil\' by the media. Among the assembled members were his children, now the mutants Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Magneto soon found himself opposed by Xavier and his own group, the X-Men. After a battle against the X-Men and the Avengers, Magneto was presumed dead, but managed to survive by using his powers to burrow through the ocean floor into a series of caverns that led him to the secluded Antarctic prehistoric jungle of the Savage Land. There, he used his knowledge of genetic engineering to mutate local savages into super-powered beings he dubbed the Savage Land Mutates. Soon after, Magneto was again opposed by the X-Men, and was once more presumed killed in an explosion. Yet again, Magneto survived, finding himself in the Savage Land city known as the \'Land of the Dead\' where he discovered a mind-numbing gas that he intended to use against mankind. He projected his astral self to the native peoples, manipulating them into building an airship filled with the gas. His plan was once again foiled by the X-Men, and he fled into the ocean. Rescued by the Mutate Amphibius, Magneto was taken to an island, where Sauron was working on a machine to tap the geothermal energies of the region. Magneto realized that the device could help restore his ailing powers, but was once again opposed by the X-Men and believed dead. Rescued by Namor the Sub-Mariner, Magneto was taken to Atlantis, where he quickly subjugated the Atlantean army and launched an attack on the surface world. He was opposed by the Fantastic Four, who used a feedback machine to trap him in a cone of his own power. Later freed, Magneto continued his genetic experiments and, using technology abandoned by the Inhumans Phaeder and Maelstrom, he created Alpha, whom he dubbed the \'Ultimate Mutant\'. Alpha turned on his creator, however, reducing Magneto and the Brotherhood to infancy. The baby Magneto was transferred to Muir Island, where geneticist Moira MacTaggert attempted to control Magneto's insane rages by manipulating his DNA so that his body would be better able to tolerate his powers. Magneto was later restored to adulthood by the Shi'ar alien Eric the Red, and initially his psychotic and destructive behavior seemed to return when he attacked the new team of X-Men off of Muir Island, and then kidnapped them, holding them prisoner under a volcano in Antarctica. After battling the X-Men in Antarctica, Magneto retreated to Asteroid M, where his mind began to heal, and MacTaggert's genetic changes began to restore his sanity. Magneto next tried to hold the world hostage to force world peace and disarmament, destroying a Russian city after warning the population to evacuate. He also sank a Russian submarine with all hands on board after the vessel attacked him. The X-Men once more stopped Magneto, but during the battle Magneto almost killed the young mutant Kitty Pryde, an act that shocked him, and forced him to reevaluate his life. Following the inadvertent destruction of Asteroid M by the extraterrestrial Warlock, Magneto crashed to Earth and was rescued from the ocean by fishing boat captain Aletys \'Lee\' Forrester who took him to an island within the Bermuda Triangle to recuperate. There, Lee experienced Magneto's \'human\' side and the pair had a brief romance. A remorseful Magneto then turned himself over to the World Court to be tried for his crimes, and would have certainly been found guilty if not for the intervention of Fenris, the twin children of Baron Strucker, who sought revenge against Magneto and Xavier for their intervention in their father's plans years earlier. The courthouse was destroyed, and Magneto and Xavier were left alone as Xavier's body deteriorated beyond repair. After Xavier's love Lilandra arrived with the space pirates the Starjammers to heal him with Shi'ar technology, Xavier made Magneto promise to protect their dream and take over as Headmaster of his School. Magneto reluctantly agreed, and came to supervise the fledgling New Mutants team while also joining the X-Men on missions. Seeking an alliance with the Hellfire Club against ever-increasing threats to them both, Magneto and the X-Men's leader Storm briefly shared the position of White King within the Club's Inner Circle before philosophical differences between Magneto and the Club's Black King Sebastian Shaw resulted in Shaw deposed as leader and Magneto assuming the unique position of \'Grey King\'. Magneto later returned to the Savage Land to oppose the priestess Zaladane, who had usurped control of the Mutates. While preparing for the inevitable confrontation, Magneto saved the X-Man Rogue from a twisted version of Ms. Marvel, and then teamed up with her, the Savage Land's protector Ka-Zar, and the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to defeat Zaladane. Despite protestations from Rogue, Magneto slew Zaladane before retreating to his rebuilt Asteroid M. There, he was approached by a group called the Acolytes, who begged him to intervene in the civil war between mutants and humans on the island nation of Genosha. Magneto agreed, and when the X-Men intervened, the Acolytes captured them and they were brought to Asteroid M to be \'reprogrammed\'. The process was a failure, however, and during the ensuing battle, Magneto was severely injured. The Acolyte Fabian Cortez, who claimed to be healing Magneto, was actually using his power-amplification ability to mask Magneto's pain, weakening him in the process. Cortez further betrayed his lord when he triggered the nuclear missiles Magneto had set up around the asteroid. It took all of Magneto's power to keep the base from blowing up, but the damage was too severe. While the X-Men escaped, Magneto and the remaining Acolytes crashed to Earth. Months later, the wreckage was discovered, but Magneto was missing. He later returned, stronger than ever, to a larger, more fanatical following of Acolytes, and co-opted the remains of Graymalkin, the space station belonging to the mutant future soldier Cable, into a new orbital base he called Avalon. When Magneto threatened the Earth once more, Xavier and the X-Men journeyed to Avalon where, after physically pulling all of the Adamantium out of Wolverine's body, his mind was wiped by Xavier and he remained on Avalon in a vegetative state. When a battle between the extra-dimensional Holocaust and the Acolytes' new leader Exodus destroyed Avalon, then-Acolyte and former X-Man Colossus placed Magneto in an escape pod which crashed to Earth. For a time it was believed that the man called Joseph was a rejuvenated Magneto, but this theory was disproved when, after the X-Men were returning from an intergalactic mission, Magneto forced their spaceship to crash in Antarctica near his old base and, posing as Erik the Red, placed Gambit on trial for his role in the infamous mutant Morlock Massacre. Upon sentencing Gambit, Magneto destroyed his former base and left, leaving the X-Men to ponder the revelations about Gambit. He then went back into hiding, emerging only briefly to kill the forger Odekirk. After a few more weeks of preparation, Magneto launched his next offensive in the form of an electromagnetic pulse that spread across the globe. This time, he was attacked by Astra, a former member of the original Brotherhood and the creator of Joseph, who was revealed to be a clone created after Astra found and healed Magneto following the fall of Avalon so as to use his DNA. She intended for the clone to kill Magneto, but he proved too resourceful and was only injured while the clone became amnesiac. Astra had Joseph attack Magneto while he was controlling the Earth's magnetosphere, which severely disrupted Earth's magnetic field and forced Magneto to fight against becoming pure electromagnetic energy. The intervention of the X-Men distracted him, however, leaving Joseph to fix the magnetosphere. Magneto was briefly subdued by the X-Men as Joseph made the ultimate sacrifice to destroy his template's machines, but before the battle could resume, the United Nations offered Magneto sovereignty over Genosha in return for some security considerations and a promise never to initiate hostilities against the nations of the world. Magneto accepted, but subsequently discovered that his powers were again failing him. Magneto set about consolidating both his mutant and political power, but faced opposition from the renegade Mutate Zealot, his son Quicksilver, and Rogue. After Magneto defeated Zealot's forces, Rogue left, and he had his Acolyte Voght manipulate Quicksilver into staying as a member of the cabinet, in the hope that he would at last learn to be a loyal son. Soon after, Magneto was revealed to be a member of the Twelve, a group of mutants supposedly destined to usher in a golden age for mutant-kind. He and the others were captured by the eternal mutant Apocalypse, who sought to usurp the power of the Twelve for himself; however, Magneto's weakness short-circuited the machine. In the ensuing clash, Magneto discovered that he could commandeer the magnetic powers of the mutant heroine Polaris and use them as his own. When Apocalypse was defeated, Magneto returned to Genosha with Polaris, and began teaching her to expand her control, while using her as a front for his own power. Over the next six months, Magneto managed to rebuild much of the war-torn country, but a rebellion in Carrion Cove proved a thorn in his side. The rebels had discovered technology in the city that they felt could not be allowed to fall into Magneto's hands, namely a genetic manipulation chamber from the process once used to create the Genoshan Mutates which would allow Magneto to restore himself to full power. Though the U.N., rogue Acolytes, Cortez, the Avengers, and Polaris all opposed him, Magneto tore down the city as a distraction to allow him to access the chamber and restore his DNA, making him more powerful than ever before. With an army of mutants at his disposal following the deadly Legacy Virus being cured, Magneto declared war on mankind. Yet again, Magneto was opposed by the X-Men, and in the ensuing clash he was severely injured by Wolverine. Recuperating, Magneto was powerless to prevent Sentinels controlled by Xavier's genetic twin Cassandra Nova from decimating the island. Magneto was again believed dead, and after a recording purported to contain his last words was found, mutant supremacist ideals became widespread in the mutant community, with some adoring him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto seemingly returned with a vengeance, infiltrating the Xavier Institute as the mutant healer Xorn, co-opting the Special Class as his new Brotherhood, and launching an attack on Manhattan. Killing Jean Grey before being killed in turn by Wolverine, it was later revealed that this Magneto was an imposter. The true Magneto was still in Genosha, where he joined Xavier in rebuilding the shattered nation. Following the dissolution of the Avengers after the Scarlet Witch suffered an apparent breakdown, Magneto rushed to her aid. When the X-Men and a new Avengers team met to discuss her fate, it seemed as though Magneto coerced her into altering reality, creating a world where mutants were the dominant species and lived openly without fear with himself as ruler. It was later revealed that Magneto's son Quicksilver was the one who actually convinced the Scarlet Witch to alter reality, in an attempt to appease their father, as well as the X-Men and Avengers who threatened to put the Scarlet Witch down. Following the events of \'M-Day,\' Magneto has apparently lost his mutant powers. Rather than kill him, Wolverine decided to let him live the rest of his life as the thing he hates the most... a human."

He passed into the DCU following Charlton's sale to DC, and was an important part of the two Crises .  Undoubtedly, though, he will always be remembered for his greater role in the run-up to Infinite Crisis . Unlike the previous Blue Beetle, Dan Garrett, Ted was really not much more than a well-trained athlete, though he did have an exceptional mind.  He was, thus, a somewhat redundant character in the DCU, given the greater prominence of the similar Batman and Mr. Terrific.  His distinction was that he was possessed of a much lighter personality than these DC-created characters, and so tended to attract a unique following of his own, despite the sameness of his \'powers\'.   He was a more realistic version of the character archetype, struggling with weight gain as he got older, and poking fun at his own lack of super powers when in the company of \'greater\' heroes like Superman. He and Booster Gold formed an alliance while in JLA service that was used, with varying degrees of fan reception,  to illustrate what the JLA was like to those who were a little lower on the roster than Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and the Flash. DC, new outright owner of both Blue Beetle II and Blue Beetle III, would eventually show that there was a relationship between the two men.  Ted was shown to be a student of the archaeologist Dan Garrett.  When a crisis struck, caused by Ted's uncle and his army of androids, Ted and Dan went to battle against them.  Dan was killed by the threat, but, ostensibly impressed by Ted's willingness to do what was right even against the wishes of a close family member, Dan entrusted Ted with the legacy of the Blue Beetle.  Unfortunately, Garrett was unable to pass his empowering scarab onto Ted, so Kord was forced to find another way to uphold the mantle. Eventually, though, Kord did come into possession of the scarab, but the wizard Shazam took it from him in the 80-page story, Countdown to Infinite Crisis , just prior to Kord's now-famous death at the hands of Maxwell Lord. When Shazam himself was killed by The Spectre in Day of Vengeance many of his \'mystical trinkets\' were shown to be scattered in the \'real\' plane of existence.  The Garrett/Kord scarab landed in El Paso, Texas, opening the door for a future Blue Beetle IV."

478,Poison Ivy (DC)(Pamela Isley),Pamela Lillian Isley,478_20070303090432_char.jpg,,,"Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley) is a fictional character, a DC Comics supervillainess who is primarily an enemy of Batman. Created by Robert Kanigher and Sheldon Moldoff, she first appeared in Batman #181 (June 1966).[1] Poison Ivy is depicted as one of the world's most prominent eco-terrorists. She is obsessed with plants, botany, and environmentalism. She uses toxins from plants and mind controlling pheromones for her criminal activities, which are usually aimed at protecting the natural environment. Fellow villain Harley Quinn became her recurring partner-in-crime and possibly her only human friend. She has proven to be one of Batman's more powerful foes, being one of the few members of his Rogues Gallery to display anything close to superpowers. Pamela Isley a.k.a. Poison Ivy has been portrayed as a love interest for Batman in some comics. In one comic, Ivy was robbing a charity gala Bruce Wayne was attending. Ivy's first kiss was poison, the second its antidote. When they first meet, Ivy's toxic lips planted a seed of toxic rapture in Bruce. But when she later kissed a dying Dark Knight, Ivy unknowingly cured her intended victim and established a budding romantic tension between them. Creator Robert Kanigher modeled Poison Ivy after Bettie Page, giving her the same haircut and Southern drawl as Page. In her first appearances in 1966, no origin was developed; she was merely a temptress. When she first arrived in Gotham City, her costume was a one-piece, strapless green bathing suit, covered with leaves. Leaves also formed her bracelets, necklace and crown. She wore green high heels and yellow-green nylon stockings with leaves painted on them. These particulars changed somewhat when she re-appeared. Poison Ivy was promoted after the rise of feminism pointed out the need for a greater number of more independent female villains in the series. She was also used to replace the increasingly sympathetic Catwoman as a clearly antagonistic female supervillain foil for Batman, and then made further appearances in the Batman comic book series and in Suicide Squad. The second, retconned origin story provided for her by Neil Gaiman in the late 1980s linked her to Swamp Thing and his original Black Orchid as a human-plant hybrid. She has since appeared in starring roles in Gotham City Sirens and Birds of Prey. In the 1997 film, Batman & Robin, she was portrayed by Uma Thurman. Poison Ivy has been featured in the television series, Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman, brought to life by voice actresses Diane Pershing and Piera Coppola respectively. She is significantly younger on The Batman than in any of her other incarnations – a teenager in fact, who nevertheless proves to be one of the most powerful criminals in the world. IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64.[2] She was ranked 21st in Comics Buyer's Guide's \'100 Sexiest Women in Comics\' list.[3] from Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(comics)"

In JLA: Rock of Ages, Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma \'superheroes\'.",,"Toni Monetti was the daughter of a former U.S. Senator from New Jersey. Around the time she turned sixteen, Toni's skin gained a silver sheen to it. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni was mysteriously teleported away. Toni, along with a few other teens, learned that they were half-alien, and their mothers were impregnated by an alien race called the H'San Natall years ago. The teens were part of a sleeper agent program created by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The group of teens stayed together, and with the funding of Loren Jupiter, became the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans.

Even though much of Byrne's Man of Steel has been recanted, the version of Superman we see in current comics is, as of September 2005, still linked narratively to the 1986 Superman.

As of July 2006, it would appear that even the post- Infinite Crisis (or \'of New Earth\') Superman is linked narratively to the Byrne Superman.  Thus, until evidence to the contrary shows up in the comics, this database will maintain that Superman has been the same character from the late 80s to the present."

While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning based spells. Also he can astral project by fear until he learns how to control it. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down forcefields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, and telekinetic force beams. It was revealed in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways that Billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others,and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.",,"Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Reform Jews Jeff Kaplan (a cardiologist ) and Rebecca Kaplan (a psychologist) Regularly bullied in school, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash heals Billy's wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied, and demonstrates his powers for the first time, but is not fully prepared for their effects. He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan. The full extent of his powers are unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from \'self-help books\' owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, \'I want Iron Lad to forget\') and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen. Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd, the Young Avenger Speed, and Billy. During the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War. S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations. When the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, \'I want you to die.\' (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him. Wiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells."
80833,Iron Man (Marvel)(Earth-55921),Antonio Stark,,"Due to an accident while he was in the womb, Tony Stark possesses higher than normal body-wide \'undifferentiated\' neural tissue, as if his whole body itself is a brain. As a result of this, he possesses a much higher than normal intelligence and a fantastic regenerative capacity. Tony has nearly total recall and a seemingly limitless capacity for multitasking. His neural tissue is a double-edged sword, however, as it makes his entire body incredibly sensitive to pain, even dust causes him excruciating pain. It also may play a role in his alcoholism, as his greater amount of neural tissue presumably multiplies the effects of alcohol. His bacterial bio-armor fits his body like a second skin, enhances his durability, and inhibits his chronic neurological pain.","Stark's body is more fragile than a normal person's, leading to the development of his armor. The armor has limited energy reserves that can be exhausted quickly in battle, though re-fueling can be performed wirelessly.","Blessed and cursed with extraordinary genius, Tony Stark was the son of inventor and defense contractor Howard Stark, and geneticist and educator Maria Stark. Howard met Maria while the two were working on an experimental biological agent that could work as body armor. The two fell in love and married. While Maria was pregnant she was bitten by a lab monkey (probably the rhesus species) and fatally infected with a regenerative virus. The virus mutated her unborn child, Tony, growing additional \'undifferentiated\' neural tissue throughout his body, as if his whole body itself is a brain, which augmented his intelligence while causing chronic pain due to the over-stimulation of the neural cells that make up his skin. Maria died during childbirth, but Howard saved Tony by coating him in their bacterial bio-armor, which consumed ordinary skin but not Tony's constantly regenerating neural flesh. Business rival Zebediah Stane married Howard's scheming ex-wife Loni, with whom he stole Stark's company, and spent years trying to seize the bio-armor, which Howard had not patented. As a teenager, Tony befriended fellow prep school student Jim Rhodes and began developing his own \'Iron Man\' armor technology. They also dealt with Zebediah's son Obadiah. Becoming a wealthy celebrity and science prodigy, young Tony founded multi-billion dollar design and manufacturing corporation Stark Enterprises. He also became an infamous playboy, alcoholic, and womanizer, suffering from recurring depression and secretly learning he was dying from an inoperable brain tumor."

373,Jessica Campbell Jones (Marvel),,373_20080116115446_char.jpg,"Flight, super strength, high resistance to injury.",,"Jessica Jones was a lonely Midtown High School student with a crush on fellow student Peter Parker (who would soon become the hero Spider-Man) and a fantasy fixation on the Human Torch. She was on a trip to Disney World with her family when her father, distracted by the backseat quarrel of her and her brother, lost control of their car in an accident with an army truck transporting unidentified experimental material, possibly radioactive, to which Jessica was exposed in the course of the accident. Her father, mother, and brother were killed, and Jessica sustained injuries that put her in a coma for months. While the Fantastic Four clashed with Galactus outside her hospital window, Jessica awoke from her coma; she was placed in a home for wayward children and later adopted by a family named Jones, whose name she took. Months after the accident, while running home from school in an emotionally distraught state, Jessica manifested superhuman powers as a result of the experimental material to which she had been exposed; her inexperienced flying led her to crash-land in the bay, where she was rescued by Thor. She soon realized that she had also gained superhuman strength. While testing her flight capabilities, she chanced upon and defeated the costumed criminal known as the Scorpion, in desperate straits not long after his first defeat by Spider-Man. Proclaimed a hero, Jessica soon took on the costumed identity of Jewel, beginning her heroic career less than three years after Spider-Man's debut. Little is known of Jessica's career as Jewel, but her activities were evidently not as high-profile as those of many of New York's other costumed heroes. Nevertheless, she remained active for around four years, befriending a handful of other heroes, until she came upon a riot provoked by the Purple Man. Using his pheromone powers to take control of her, the Purple Man directed her to attack the approaching police, then held her in his thrall for months, subjecting her to physical and mental humiliation in imagined retaliation for his defeats by other super heroes. Finally, in a fit of insane rage, he sent Jessica to Avengers Mansion hoping she would find and kill his nemesis, Daredevil. Jessica attacked the first hero she saw, the Scarlet Witch, an act that snapped her out of the Purple Man's control. Unprepared to explain her actions, she fled and was pursued by the Avengers, taking a powerful blow from the Vision. Ms. Marvel rescued her from further attack, but Jessica was rendered comatose and cared for in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility until Phoenix of the X-Men telepathically helped her regain her faculties. After weeks of physical rehabilitation, she was offered the position of S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to the Avengers, but Jessica felt that her experience had taught her that she was unsuited to the life of a costumed hero, and she gave up her Jewel identity. Moreover, she found that the Purple Man's mistreatment had left her emotionally unsure of herself, particularly in romantic endeavors. Details of Jessica's subsequent life are sparse, although it is known that she was involved in a string of relationships that ended badly, including one with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain. She also became close friends with Ms. Marvel, who would undergo her own share of trauma during her Avengers membership and afterward. At one point Jessica attempted to return to costumed action as the Knightress, but this period was brief. She eventually became a licensed private investigator and opened her own firm, Alias Investigations. Jessica's recent string of cases included a surveillance assignment involving a woman whose companion was revealed to be Captain America, who changed from his then-secret identity into costume before Jessica's video camera; when the woman whom he had been photographed with was slain, Jessica realized she had been set up. She was questioned by suspicious police officers but helped out of her predicament by the timely arrival of attorney Matt Murdock. Her investigation led to a fight with enforcer Man-Mountain Marko and the revelation that she had been expected to publicize the video with the intent of creating a scandal defaming Captain America and the US government. With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D., Jessica exposed the plot's mastermind, a man named Zoumas, and received the thanks of Captain America, who encouraged her to return to the heroic life. Jessica next investigated a deranged man claiming to be Avengers associate Rick Jones, who paranoically feared attack by the alien races in whose war the real Jones had intervened. Jessica managed to partially calm his madness and reunited him with his wife. She was then hired by J. Jonah Jameson in an effort to track Spider-Man, only to bilk the publisher by spending his money on charitable endeavors. An out-of-town case led her to help troubled teen Rebecca Cross, who had run away after encouraging people to believe she was a mutant out of rebellion against her town's oppressive atmosphere, but the case ended badly when Rebecca's aunt killed her unjustly accused father. When Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdock was exposed, Murdock hired Jessica and the hero-for-hire Luke Cage as bodyguards. This initially proved awkward as Jessica and Cage had had a brief fling which strained their friendship, but they soon resolved their difficulties. Jessica instead began dating Scott Lang, the Avenger known as Ant-Man, with whom she was set up by her friend Carol Danvers, formerly Ms. Marvel and now Warbird. She next found herself investigating the Mutant Growth Hormone trade, and teamed up with fellow superhuman investigator and ex-costumed heroine Jessica Drew to rescue Mattie Franklin, the young heroine formerly known as Spider-Woman, from being misused by the dealers. She also hired the dedicated but annoying young Malcolm Powder as a part-time assistant. When the Kingpin sent the insane assassin Typhoid Mary against Murdock, Jessica and Cage worked together against her, getting her on the ropes so that Murdock could deliver a blow to end the fight. Jessica's greatest challenge came when relatives of some of the Purple Man's victims asked her to confront the imprisoned villain about his many murders, several of them committed on whims, in hopes that he would give their families a sense of closure by confessing to his killings. She was greatly apprehensive about confronting her former tormentor, but being consoled by Cage, she agreed to visit the Purple Man in prison, only to receive no useful information from the psychopathic mind-controller. The Purple Man then escaped in the chaos caused by the breakout of fellow prisoner Carnage, and he sought out Jessica in order to again control her. When the Avengers arrived, he commanded Jessica to fight them, but she activated a psychic defense trigger left in her mind by Phoenix years earlier and defied him, knocking him out with one blow. In the aftermath of the confrontation, Jessica informed Ant-Man that she was pregnant with another man's child and the couple broke up. She instead moved in with Cage, the father, and the two began a long-term relationship. Jessica has since taken a position as a superhuman consultant with the Daily Bugle, working with reporter Ben Urich on stories related to New York's growing super hero population. After their daughter was born, Jessica and Luke were married in the company of their heroic friends."

80832,Loni Stane (Marvel)(Earth-55921),,,,,"Loni was a greedy opportunist, always on the lookout for a man who could provide her with a life of wealth and privilege. She found such a man in industrialist Howard Stark. The two were married and they remained together until Howard's company, the Stark Defense Corporation, began suffering financially. This was due largely to Howard's investment in Biotech Armor, whose untested processes caused Stark's stock to plummet. Fearing for her future, Loni divorced Stark and took half of his assets in the settlement and then began sleeping with Zebediah Stane, Stark's chief competitor. Loni (being a gold digger) agreed with Stane in taking Stark's company apart (Howard was most likely too distracted as his second wife gave birth their son). Later, Loni had her and Stane's son. After Stane was sent to prison for kidnapping Stark's young son, Loni divorced Stane and acquired even more money from the settlement. Sometime later, she meets a teenage Tony Stark and his friend James Rhodes as well as seeing the younger Stark's prototype armor. She later pleaded with her ex-husband to provide Obadiah Stane (her son) with a secure education via a stay at the government think tank known as the Baxter Building. Later, Tony thinks it was Loni that's the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them and set off to Utah to find Loni. When they arrive, Obadiah falls off a cliff but Tony (in his prototype Iron Man armor) catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni and their hideout. When Tony breaks into the compound, Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Stark saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards (because she wanted no witnesses), Loni confesses to the elder Stark that all she ever wanted was power. That’s why she married Howard, divorced him, married Zebadiah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebadiah killed. Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. After Tony takes off his armor, Loni says she wondered what it was like if she stayed with Howard, had given him a child, and if she had been Tony's mother. Then, Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to Howard. Obadiah, mad that Loni (his mother) abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her."

940,Ragman (DC)(Post Crisis)(01 - Rory Regan),Rory Regan,940_20070222200901_char.jpg,"Ragman Suit: The Great Collector Artifact, a mystical Jewish artifact created to protect the Jewish communities ever since the time of Abraham. Telekinetic Suit Control: Also, the Ragman possesses a number of minor magical powers, such as kinetically controlling the suit (i.e. entangling Eclipso with his cloak while grappling with her) Multitude of Forms: It has recently been revealed that the suit can take on other forms, such as weapons, and still collect souls. Whether Rory will use this ability in the future is yet to be seen. Precognitive Dreams: Rory had occasional precognitive dreams, though they were too vague to provide useful information Superhuman Durability: Regan is the latest Ragman, an avenger and protector empowered by a mystical suit. While the wearer is bonded to the Ragman costume, he is almost impossible to destroy. While his durability is only slightly superhuman, any damage sustained is repaired in seconds. Superhuman Agility: It gives the users prodigious leaping ability Levitation: can slowly float through the air Discorporate: discorporate and reform great distances away. The latter form of discorporation can also be used in a more limited manner to avoid physical attacks by allowing the rags to simply flow around objects as well as to ensnare nearby opponents by smothering them in a cloud of rags. Sense Evil Souls: Perhaps the most macabre of the costume's abilities is the stealing of souls. The suit is drawn toward evil souls; it can sense them in its vicinity and is compelled to seek them out and attack them. This compulsion is also inflicted upon the wearer if he has the costume on. The evil acts of people who have been detected in this manner can also be sensed by the Ragman. This sensing of sins does not work on those people or beings who are not evil. Steal Soul: The suit can steal a person's soul as long as it is still touching his body. Ragman will usually subdue a target (knock them unconscious or Stun them) to minimize their ability to resist, but this is not necessary. Once a soul is absorbed, the body is left a brain-dead husk and the mind and spirit become yet another rag on the costume. The stolen soul is not affected if the physical body subsequently dies. The costume can steal souls that are not evil. Indeed, on two occasions the ability to absorb the souls of good people was essential for keeping the suit under control. On another occasion, Rory attempted to use the suit to absorb the amoral soul of a mystic servitor. He was able to begin the process but the servitor fought it off, indicating that the suit has difficulty absorbing the souls of mystically-powerful creatures. Boost Physical Attributes: After a soul is incorporated into the Ragman suit, it can be used in several ways. Its energy can be directed into boosting the wearer's strength, speed, coordination, and fighting prowess. When the wearer uses it in this manner, he can become such a skilled combatant that he can easily defeat a roomful of armed men without being struck in return a single time in the process. Boost Influence: This energy can also be directed into making the Ragman's influence more formidable -- when concentrating on such actions, the mere presence of the Ragman can make groups of armed gunmen stop attacking or even flee the scene. Absorbed Memory Recall: The wearer can also look into the memories of the absorbed soul and extract any information therein as desired. It is also possible that the wearer might be able to use some of the abilities possessed by the souls in the rag suit -- using a captured sorcerer's memories to cast spells, for example -- but this is only speculation. Soul Redemption: There is an implied redemption of evil souls contained within the rag suit, but no mechanism for this has yet been shown. Rory's comments seem to indicate that this redemption is linked to the soul willingly assisting the wearer in his mission and thus slowly working off its moral debt. This process has been stated to take a century or more. While the souls power the suit, no single soul seems to make a noticeable difference in the Ragman's power levels. Accordingly, the acquisition or loss of souls as time goes by is usually not a serious concern to the current trustee of the costume. Telepathic Bond: Like all of those who have trained in the use of the suit, Rory has formed a rudimentary telepathic bond with the Ragman costume. He can communicate with the suit's collective personality -- though he speaks out loud, only he can hear the suit's replies. Rory also uses this trait to summon the suit to him over short distances. Sense Disposition: Though detailed exchanges are only possible at short range, those attuned to the suit in this manner can still get a general sense of its disposition while active, and vice versa. For example, the Rabbi who trained Gerry sensed when the suit became active again (when Rory first put it on) and where it was despite being an unknown distance away. The suit also sensed when the Rabbi passed away and relayed that information to Rory even though the Rabbi was no longer in the same city as Rory and the suit when he died. Rory has not as yet developed this second talent -- it may require additional special training in Jewish mystic rituals such as the Rabbi had. Inspire Hope: Because the Ragman was created as a symbol of hope to protect communities, he can over time form a limited psychic bond with the people of a given neighborhood. When this process is complete, the people of the community will find themselves acting as one with the Ragman to confront local threats. Once this occurs, the Ragman's work is finished and he will move on, teleporting to a new place that needs his help. How the suit determines where the Ragman is needed next is unknown. The suit has an additional failsafe that compels the wearer to teleport away if the battle for a neighborhood is hopeless. The Ragman was meant to inspire hope, so staying to fight a lost cause would be futile; the suit's creators felt it was better to have the Ragman live to fight another day rather than be destroyed.","Fire Vulnerability: However, the rags are extremely vulnerable to fire, a weakness added by the Rabbis who created the Ragman as a security measure in case the suit fell into the wrong hands. Pain of Soul Taking: However, Rory has mentioned that the process of acquiring a new soul gives him stomach cramps and nausea.","A community of Jews in 16th century Eastern Europe created the Ragman to replace the Golem, their previous defender. Gerry Regan was the last European Ragman, as he, still named Jerzy Reganiewicz, fled to the United States after failing to protect the Jewish population from Nazi persecution. After settling down in Gotham City, Regan passed the mantle of Ragman to his son Rory. Rory Regan is a ragman, doing good in his community by buying used items from people who need money. The suit of rags that he wears was originally just a costume made from materials found around the rag shop he shared with his father, Rags'n'Tatters. Currently each of the patches in the suit is made from the soul of an evildoer that the Ragman had punished and absorbed. The absorption of these souls caused a problem for Rory at one point, when the evil souls hungered for murder and finally freed themselves of Ragman. It was only with the support of Batman and Regan's old friend, Rabbi Luria, that he regained control, though at the cost of Luria's life. Ragman's powers have increased since then. Currently, he can absorb souls into his costume. With each new soul added, a rag is added. He can call upon the souls in his costume to lend him their attributes or power. He is also a very proficient magic user. Judgment and Vengeance Ragman was active in destroying many of the demons invading Earth. This would earn him the wrath of the Diablos, a group of demons who style themselves after the Mafia. Wanting to gain revenge for demons lost during the Day of Judgment, they attack Ragman, injuring him and tearing off parts of his costume. They believe him to be dead but this is not true. Ragman is one of the members of the Shadowpact, a team that formed to confront the Spectre. During 'Infinite Crisis', Ragman and Nightshade are seen standing side by side as part of the line of superheroes defending Metropolis from attack from dozens of villains. Ragman is one of the few volunteers willing to take on the rampaging Spectre, who has decided that all magic is evil. During a planning sessions, he is taken aside by the Enchantress and given a mystical gun. She entrusts him with it, as it can kill her if she goes too far with her magic, a scenario she believes is all too possible. He tells her if she truly turns evil, his costume will take her. He then tries to kiss her, but his feelings are not returned and Enchantress even mocks him for it in front of the other heroes. Shadowpact Ragman, along with his teammates, was trapped inside a shield of solid blood that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. Ragman and the rest of the team spend a very short period of time inside the shield, but to due to magical after-effects, a full year passes outside. Various mystical heroes, such as Phantom Stranger and Rex the Wonder Dog keep watch outside the town's borders. While inside Riverrock, Rory met an evil counterpart of himself belonging to the supervillain group that had formed the shield, the Pentacle. His counterpart is named Bagman. He/it dresses in similar green garb, and can turn his body to goo and while in this form he absorbs people. While inside Bagman they either suffocate or they are digested. Bagman even mentioned how oddly similar the Shadowpact and the Pentacle are. Rory only survives this encounter because Bagman's boss does not want the heroes to be killed. After the Riverock encounter, Rory must deal with the severe disruption to his life, as everyone had thought he was dead. He, like most of the team, ends up having to find a new source of income, a place to stay and the oddity of encountering a memorial statue to the entire team. Rory was temporarily trapped in the limbo dimension of his own cloak. He met the soul of an ancient Centurion working off his crimes. This man, Marcus Liberius, first saved him from the beating several other of the murderous souls were giving Rory. Marcus reveals that the cloak was actually the \'Great Collector Artifact\', which has been in existence in many forms since the time of Abraham. Ragmen in Rory's line have been in action since 1812 BCE. Marcus also helped Rory, who had become disenchanted with the job of collecting corrupted souls, to see that he is not a punisher but a redeemer — allowing a better afterlife for those who work for it. This work usually takes the form of suffering on Rory's behalf. For example, Rory had been recently blinded by magic. Marcus willingly takes this blindNess on, adding to previous injuries he had suffered. This last sacrifice allows Marcus, in the full view of the rest of the Shadowpact, to ascend to a higher realm."

He was due to be executed by King Philip of Spain, when the King learned he had just married his own ward, Donna Bonita.  The King then struck a bargain with Valor, promising him life, if he would serve the Spanish flag.  Valor agreed under the condition that the flag would always represent the cause of justice.  Eventually, though, Spain disappointed, and Valor fled back to England.   He and Donna had a son, Justin, who took to the seas with him.  Justin, though, eventually was injured, forcing Valor to rethink his life.   He thus unmasked himself before King Charles and swore to disavow the pirate's life forever.  HIs son, though, had made no such vow, and became embroiled in the cause of the Puritans.  Needing cash for their impending journey to America, Justin pirated Charles' vessels for the Puritans.  Charles called Valor out of retirement to discover who was behind this new wave of pirating.  When Jon investigated he was shocked to discover it was his own son.  They made a peace, however, that allowed Justin to set sail for America with the Puritans, and satisfy Charles' requirement that Jon end the wave of pirating. Long gone from the pages of comic books, the Black Pirate recently appeared in Robinson's 90's Starman revival--as a ghost."

368,Black Adam (DC)(Post Crisis),Teth-Adam,368_20070317133049_char.jpg,,,"In this revised origin (told in Power of Shazam! #10), Teth-Adam was the son of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses II, and impressed one of the high priests, the wizard Shazam, with his good deeds. The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (Horus), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of Aton, and the courage of Mehen. Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter Blaze in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery and, as a result, unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's de-powered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse. Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of Rameses II, where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero was referred to as \'Khem-Adam\' (\'Black Adam\'). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam went several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name. The original Power of Shazam! graphic novel (which predated the publication of the series by a year) explained how Black Adam was revived and introduced into the modern world. In this story, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, an archaeological dig financed by the Sivana Foundation to excavate the tomb of Rameses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam became obsessed with the artifact, and killed both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping Egypt, Theo Adam soon made his way back to America. The Batsons' son, Billy, had been left behind in the United States, and was soon appointed to become Captain Marvel, the second champion of the wizard Shazam. When Theo Adam first encountered Captain Marvel, he noted both Marvel's identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore had a revelation, and realized that he was a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam spoke the wizard's Shazam's name and was transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam revealed himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battled. Captain Marvel emerged victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brought Theo Adam to Shazam, who wiped Adam's memory and took away his voice, so that he could not access his powers."

9,Cyclops (Marvel)(03 - Scott Summers),Scott Summers,9_20050924203346_char.jpg,"Cyclops possesses the mutant ability to project a beam of heat-less ruby-colored concussive force from his eyes, which act as inter-dimensional apertures between this universe and another. Cyclops' body constantly absorbs ambient energy, such as sunlight, from his environment into his body's cells that allows him to open the apertures. Cyclops' mind generates a psionic field that is attuned to the forces that maintain the apertures. Because this field envelops his body, it automatically shunts the other-dimensional particles back into their point of origin when they collide with his body. Thus, his body is protected from the effects of the particles, and even the thin membranes of his eyelids are sufficient to block the emission of energy. The synthetic ruby quartz crystal used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops' eye-wear is resonant to his minds' psionic field and is similarly protected. The width of Cyclops' optic blast is focused by his mind's psionic field with the same autonomic function that regulated his original eyes' ability to focus. As Cyclops focuses, the size of the apertures change and thus act as a valve to control the flow of particles and the beam's relative power. The height of Cyclops's eye-blast is controlled by his visor's adjustable slit. The beam's effective range is approximately 2,000 feet. Due to a head injury, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts at will and must therefore wear ruby quartz lenses to block the beams.",,"Scott Summers was the first of two sons born to Major Christopher Summers, a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, and his wife Katherine. Christopher was flying his family home from vacation when their plane was attacked by a spacecraft from the interstellar Shi'ar Empire. To save their lives, Katherine pushed Scott and his brother Alex out of the plane with the only available parachute. Scott suffered a head injury upon landing, thus forever preventing him from controlling his mutant power by himself. With their parents presumed dead, the authorities separated the two boys. Alex was adopted, but Scott remained comatose in a hospital for a year. On recovering, he was placed in an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska that was secretly controlled by his future enemy, the evil geneticist Mister Sinister. As a teenager, Scott came into the foster care of Jack Winters, a mutant criminal known as the Jack O'Diamonds. After Scott began to suffer from severe headaches he was sent to a specialist who discovered that lenses made of ruby quartz corrected the problem. Soon after, Scott's mutant power first erupted from his eyes as an uncontrollable blast of optic force. The blast demolished a crane, causing it to drop its payload toward a terrified crowd. Scott saved lives by obliterating the object with another blast, but the bystanders believed that he had tried to kill them and rallied into an angry mob. Scott fled, escaping on a freight train. Winters sought to use Scott's new-found talent in his crimes, and physically abused the young boy when he initially refused. However, Scott's display of power had attracted the attention of the mutant telepath Professor Charles Xavier, who teamed up with F.B.I. agent Fred Duncan in their mutual attempt to find Scott. Scott was rescued from Winters' clutches and was enlisted by Xavier as the first member of the X-Men, a team of young mutants who trained to use their powers in the fight for human/mutant equality. As Cyclops, Scott became deputy leader of the X-Men. While he was a skilled tactician, his social skills were lacking. Scott had fallen in love with his teammate Jean Grey, but his reserved demeanor prevented him from expressing his feelings for her for years. When Xavier's other original recruits left the fold following an encounter with the sentient island-being Krakoa, Cyclops stayed on as deputy leader of the new team. Shortly thereafter, the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force took Jean's place. When it committed suicide, Scott believed the love of his life had died and he left the X-Men. During his time away from the team, Scott met fishing boat captain Lee Forrester who helped him work through his grief. Scott eventually returned to the X-Men whereupon he met Madelyne Pryor, a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Jean. Unaware that Madelyne was a clone of Jean created by Sinister, Scott fell in love with Madelyne and they were soon married. Madelyne fell pregnant and bore Scott a son named Nathan Christopher. When the real Jean emerged from suspended animation, Scott abandoned his wife and son and rejoined the other original X-Men in establishing a new team, X-Factor. During a demonic invasion of New York City, X-Factor and the X-Men fought against a super-powered and insane Madelyne. The invasion was thwarted after Madelyne perished in combat with Jean. Later, the mutant warlord named Apocalypse infected baby Nathan with a techno-organic virus. To save his son's life, Scott had to allow a member of the Clan Askani to transport Nathan two millennia into the future, where it had been foreseen that he would deliver the world from Apocalypse’s clutches. X-Factor disbanded soon after, and its members returned to the ranks of the X-Men. Scott and his long-time love Jean were married, and whilst on their honeymoon their spirits were taken into the time-stream by the Clan Askani’s matriarch. Arriving in the future, they inhabited new bodies and raised Nathan for twelve years. When they returned to their own time and bodies, Nathan remained in the future and ultimately matured into his time's greatest hero: Cable. Following Professor X's arrest for crimes committed as the evil psionic entity Onslaught, Scott assumed the role of leadership of the X-Men once more. Soon after, the government sponsored mutant-hunting operation known as \'Zero Tolerance\' took effect, and the villainous Bastion captured the X-Men. In his attempt to destroy mutant-kind, Bastion placed a nanotech bomb inside Scott’s body. The X-Men escaped, and the mutant doctor named Cecilia Reyes saved Scott’s life. Scott and his wife soon took a leave of absence from the X-Men for a period of recuperation. Not long after returning to the team, Scott and Jean soon found themselves embroiled in Apocalypse's bid for cosmic power by assembling \'The Twelve\' - a group of mutants who would determine the fate of their kind that included Scott, Jean, and Cable. They were wired to a machine that would channel their awesome energies into Apocalypse, allowing him to absorb the body of the time-tossed powerful mutant teenager known as X-Man. As his teammates fell around him, a powerless Scott saved X-Man and merged with the would-be conqueror to create a new evil entity. Jean detected Scott's psyche inside Apocalypse and prevented the X-Men from destroying him, however he was presumed dead by most of his teammates. Only Jean and Cable refused to believe Scott had perished. Investigating rumors he was alive, the pair found him in the birthplace of Apocalypse in Akkaba, Egypt, struggling to reassert his mind over the villain's psyche. Ultimately, Jean was able to physically rip Apocalypse's essence from Scott's body using her mental powers, and Cable destroyed it with his own powers. Scott left for a small period of recuperation, during which he met and reconciled with his father. Afterwards, Scott returned to the X-Men, but his association with Apocalypse had given him a grimmer, more serious personality than ever before. As a result, many of his relationships became strained, including his marriage to Jean. Scott sought the counsel of his teammate Emma Frost and the pair began a psychic affair. When Jean discovered Scott's betrayal, he left the X-Men in order to sort out the mess his life had become. Following the outing of Professor X as a mutant to the world, his school was rechristened the Xavier Institute of Higher Learning and opened its doors to the mutant population at large, training and educating dozens of young new students to help them cope with their burgeoning abilities. After the death of his wife, Scott assumed the position of co-headmaster of the School alongside his new love, Emma. Cyclops's world was further upset when a mysterious mutant attacked and brought him and Marvel Girl to a secret abandoned facility. Cyclops eventually discovered that the mutant was none other than his brother Gabriel, who had been a student of Moira's that Professor X had sent to rescue Scott from Krakoa. Scott had witnessed the apparent deaths of Gabriel and his teammates; Xavier had mind-wiped him to alleviate the psychic trauma of the event. Shaken to the core, Cyclops expelled the then powerless Xavier from the Institute. Recently, a teenage version of Cyclops (along with the rest of the original X-Men) was brought from the past and is stranded in the present. This Cyclops has since been a member of the Starjammers and the Champions."

However, he wants a career as a performing magician, so he goes back in time to find an audience to entertain and soon clashes with the Flash (Barry Allen). His \'magic\' is actually based on advanced technology, disguised with supernatural trappings. One of his more heinous acts is kidnapping Linda Park, the girlfriend of Wally West (Barry Allen's protege and successor), during their wedding and erasing her from history, though he is ultimately defeated. He also tricks five rogues into selling their souls to Neron so he can gain real magic powers. Abra Kadabra makes an appearance in The Flash:The Fastest Man Alive #7 (Feb 2007), attempting to steal a vault filled with precious diamonds. Kadabra is carrying out a performance in Los Angeles (Bart Allen's town) for a fresh start when he tried to commit the robbery; his actions are foiled by the only man \'faster than 64th century tech.\' Abra Kadabra is mentioned in Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic miniseries.

1813,Kang (Marvel),Nathaniel Richards (Kang),1813_20060329073117_char.jpg,"Kang ages at a slightly slower rate than modern humanity. Kang typically carries various weapons, such as an anti-matter defense screen generator, a \'vibration-ray\' projector, an electromagnetic field-amplifier, neutrino-ray warheaded missile launcher (hand-gun size), electrical paralysis generator, nerve gas sprayer, and a molecular expander. Kang commands a vast armada of warriors from across the galaxy of his future era. He uses numerous robots, most notably his Growing-Man stimuloids, packed with the \'Growth Pollen\' of the world Kosmos, which causes them to grow in size and strength by absorbing kinetic energy. Kang's primary base in 40th-century Other Earth is the Center, but he also maintains a secret dwelling in the realm known only as Purgatory, as well as strongholds in various alternate realties. His former base Chronopolis, powered by the Heart of Forever, served as a crossroads into virtually every era in human history, but lay just out of phase with the timestream and was therefore undetectable. Its palace and inhabitants were unaffected by temporal divergence or the passage of time. Kang formerly employed a 20' long space-worthy vehicle housing his time machine, which could reach all eras of all timelines by accessing the transtemporal realm of Limbo. Kang has used a number of other vessels, such as his Sphinx ship and Damocles Base, an immense sword-shaped orbiting headquarters.",,"Nathaniel Richards was born in the calendar year 3000 of the alternate timeline Other Earth (a.k.a. Earth-6311). Bullied as a youth, his throat was slit by a bully, Morgan, and he was hospitalized for a year. Recovering, he studied science and his ancestor's history tapes of the heroic age of Earth-616 (mainstream Earth), growing into a man of adventure in a time of complacency. At age 25 he discovered his ancestor's fortress and time machine. Following encounters with alternate Earth Fantastic Fours seeking to thwart his future self, which faded from his mind, Richards constructed an immense sphinx-shaped ship and traveled to Egypt circa 2950 BC. The ship crashed, blinding and stranding him there, but he subjugated the natives with his technology. He forced the natives to procure for him a radioactive herb which would restore his sight, then, as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, he ruled as a god for a decade, during which he encountered Samira, Mistress of the Nile, who became his enemy; Amenhotep, whom he transformed into a vampiric creature; and time-travelers such as Killpower and the Genetix team. At some point he had a son, Ramades, by a slave. Eventually, a struggle with the Fantastic Four, which also involved the young En Sabah Nur (later Apocalypse), the moon god Khonshu, and modern-era heroes Dr. Strange and the Avengers, forced Rama to flee that time period. En route to the future, a \'time storm\' diverted Rama to the modern era and an encounter with a space-lost Dr. Doom. Damaged by the time storm, Rama-Tut's control module skipped several years into the future and briefly crashed in Egypt, where he fought fellow time-travelers Blaquesmith and Cable. Inspired by Doom, he took the armored identity of the Scarlet Centurion, traveled to another timeline (Earth-689) and duped its Avengers into neutralizing all their fellow heroes so he could rule; but he was defeated by the visiting Avengers of Earth-616 and cast outside time. Richards sought to return to his native time, but temporal disruptions hurled him into Other Earth's 40th century. As Kang, he conquered that entire world, sparing only the tiny kingdom of Carelius due to his interest in the king's daughter, Ravonna. Kang's life became progressively non-linear, as each foray in time produced at least one divergent-timestream counterpart; it is extremely difficult to identify which Kang counterpart was involved with each encounter. Conquering everything within 100 light years, Kang next attacked his ancestor's world in the modern age of marvels, but the Avengers forced him to flee. Seeking a new power base, Kang established himself in 1901 AD as Victor Timely, a brilliant inventor and industrialist who founded the city of Timely, Wisconsin, became its first mayor, and transformed it into a technological marvel over the next century; \'Victor\' appeared to age and be replaced by his children (Kang in new guises). The city also housed a portal to his base Chronopolis where he gathered warriors from various eras to serve as his strike force, the Anachronauts. Kang's continued efforts saw his Spider-Man robot (Timespinner) destroyed by the Avengers and Spider-Man, and his conquest of Camelot foiled by the time-traveling Thing and Human Torch. He also assaulted the Reed and Sue Richards wedding, unknowingly drawn there by Dr. Doom's Emotion-Charger device. Returning to the 40th century, Kang completed his galactic conquest and even invaded other dimensions. In Kosmos, he gained technology to create his powerful Growing Men. Kang then brought the Avengers forward in time, intending to subjugate them or defeat them in front of Ravonna. When both the Avengers and Ravonna defied him, the furious Kang easily conquered her small kingdom; however, when he tried to force Ravonna to marry him, he caused unrest in his troops for failing to follow his own edict of slaying all conquered rulers. Kang's troops, led by General Baltag, turned on him, but he allied with the Avengers to defeat them. Impressed that Kang had risked his life for her, Ravonna leapt in the path of a blast from the defeated Baltag, saving Kang, but apparently dying in his place. The devastated Kang sought to restore Ravonna. Later, the cosmic Grandmaster challenged him to a contest of champions, offering him the power of life or death as the prize. Using the Avengers as pawns, Kang was victorious, but he chose the power of death, intending to slay the Avengers. Foiled by the Black Knight, Kang had to live with the knowledge that he had squandered his chance to save Ravonna. Disturbed at having lost and feeling sympathy for Ravonna, the Grandmaster removed Ravonna from stasis, revived her, and told her of Kang's betrayal. Moving on, Kang tried to use the Hulk to destroy Bruce Banner's ancestor to prevent the Avengers from ever forming, but the Hulk foiled this plot. Kang then sent a robot double of himself to capture the Avengers during a war with rival time lord Zarrko the Tomorrow Man. One of Kang's most relentless campaigns was his quest for the Celestial Madonna, a woman fated to give birth to the most powerful being in the universe. Wanting to be that being's father, Kang narrowed the Madonna's identity to Agatha Harkness, Mantis, and the Scarlet Witch, abducting all three. Rama-Tut, actually Kang's own future self, arrived to help the Avengers thwart his plot. Mantis was finally revealed as the Madonna, and when Kang could not claim her, he tried to kill her; but his fatal blast was intercepted by the Swordsman, who died instead. Kang and Rama-Tut were then pulled into Limbo by Immortus, a potential future self of both men, but Kang imprisoned Immortus and used his technology to create the Legion of the Unliving, a team of reportedly deceased pawns drawn from past eras. The Avengers defeated the Legion and Kang fled. Kang soon returned, allied with a trio of Kangs from different time periods, and tried to abduct Mantis at her wedding, but Immortus foiled him by substituting a Space Phantom as his captive. Kang next made a base in Tombstone, Arizona, circa 1873 AD, intending to use it as a stepping stone to conquer the modern age. Opposed by cowboy heroes, as well as time-traveling Avengers, Kang disintegrated when his force field shorted out in battle with Thor. However, a failsafe device transported Kang's consciousness to an alternate body, as it had during many other near-death experiences. Though taking place in rapid succession in the modern era, these last two campaigns accounted for ten years of Kang's life. Less time-intensive efforts included seeking the reality-altering power of a Cosmic Cube, facilitating an attempt by the Inuit (Eskimo) Aningan Kenojuak to reclaim Captain America as the \'God in the Ice\' worshipped by his people years ago, conquering an alternate 40th-century Earth, battling the legendary First Line, and participating in the hero vs. villain war on the virtually omnipotent Beyonder's Battleworld. Kang then found his 40th-century base ravaged by rebels loyal to Baltag. To recover his base, he sought out a Growing Man stored in the modern era and battled Thor, who banished him to Limbo. There Kang chanced across Immortus' stronghold, Tenebrae, and learned of his own multitude of divergent counterparts. Unwittingly manipulated by Immortus, Kang formed the Council of Kangs, choosing a few of his most capable counterparts as allies, and began eliminating redundant Kangs from each alternate reality. One of these sought to pair with an alternate Ravonna and wipe out all other realities, but was eliminated after accidentally killing his lover. Kang prepared robot duplicates to replace the slain counterparts to rule the empires of every Kang in existence. At the same time, Kang re-took his 40th-century base via his Growing Man. After the rest of the counterparts were eliminated, the prime Kang slew the rest of the Council. Immortus then appeared, explained that he was Kang's future self, and showed Kang a psyche-globe containing the memories of all of the slain divergent Kangs. Kang tore the globe from his hands, only to go mad as the minds of all of the other Kangs merged with his. The last Kang-now every Kang, since he possessed all of his counterparts' memories-fled into Limbo. To save himself, Kang used his helmet's temporal circuitry to create an additional divergence/counterpart, dividing his madness between two Kangs. One made his way to Chronopolis to recuperate, while the other, still addled, was recruited by the Cross-Time Kangs, a group of beings who had defeated or slain alternate Kangs and usurped the Kang identity. That Kang learned of a plot by Kang-Nebula (actually a power-hungry Ravonna) to obtain the \'ultimate weapon\' within the Time Bubble, a period of time in Earth-8810 surrounded by an impassable temporal barrier. A trio of Kangs followed Kang-Nebula into the Time Bubble where they were cast into the vortex surrounding it and ultimately destroyed, though the divergent Kang also sent his Growing Man to help foil the demonic Inferno invasion of Earth. Taking control of Chronopolis, the prime Kang sought revenge on Mantis in the modern era, joined Dr. Doom during the Infinity War, took over the Cross-Time Kangs, learned an assassin was stalking him, and exposed his would-be killer as Ravonna, now calling herself the Terminatrix. Intrigued by her warrior nature, Kang battled her, but sacrificed himself to save her from an assault by the Avengers. Overcoming her hatred for Kang, Ravonna impersonated him and took over the Cross-Time Kangs. When Chronopolis was attacked by the immensely powerful temporal entity Alioth, Ravonna revived Kang, and with the aid of the Avengers they sacrificed the Cross-Time Kangs, using their energy to imprison Alioth. The reunited Kang and Ravonna (who posed as Victor Timely's fiancée Rebecca Tourmenet for a time) soon ruled Chronopolis side by side. However, Kang, now almost sixty, grew weary of administrative matters. Missing the days when he was worshipped in a small land, Kang returned to ancient Egypt circa 2930 BC as Rama-Tut and smashed his chrono-sphere. As Rama-Tut, he spent ten years benevolently enjoying his people's adulation. In 2920 BC he encountered the Avengers, who had been trapped in the past by a time machine that could only travel backwards in time. Determined not to become Immortus (whose subtle manipulations he despised), the later Rama-Tut tried to break the cycle by placing himself in suspended animation, reviving in the modern era to battle his past Kang self during the Celestial Madonna struggle. Failing to change the course of events and feeling resigned to his fate, Rama headed for Limbo, but upon glimpsing a chrono-flash of Immortus bowing to the powerful Time-Keepers, he was infuriated by the idea of becoming anyone's lap-dog, and vowed to overcome his destiny. Rama-Tut returned to Chronopolis, resumed his Kang identity and used his rivals to destroy each other. He then destroyed the mind-transfer failsafe device he had so often used to cheat death, feeling that it took the risk-and thus the enjoyment-out of conflict. After a brief battle with the X-Men and an enterprising starship crew, Kang formed an alliance with Libra (Gustav Brandt), the Kree Supreme Intelligence and the Avengers against Immortus and the Time-Keepers. Ravonna and the Anachronauts were apparently slain and Chronopolis was destroyed, but Kang managed to destroy the Time-Keepers and forcibly diverge himself from Immortus, leaving his future uncharted. Renewed by this victory, Kang engineered a series of successors, each of whom he named Marcus. These infants were sent back in time and trained to be warriors worthy of inheriting Kang's empire. Following a failed effort to conquer the realm Otherworld, Kang, alongside Marcus XXIII (outfitted as the Scarlet Centurion), used Damocles Base, his massive armada, and alliances with various criminal forces (including rogue Atlanteans and Deviants) to conquer Earth; but the Avengers led a rebellion that ultimately defeated and imprisoned Kang. Marcus freed Kang in hopes of restoring their dominion, but Kang knew that Marcus had held back during the war more than once because of his attraction to Avengers member Warbird. Unable to forgive this betrayal, Kang slew Marcus. Disheartened, Kang told his computer to postpone development of Marcus XXIV. Regaining his focus, Kang plotted against Iron Lad, his younger self created by his meddling in his own past, and his allies in the Young Avengers. Note: Differences between the history of Other-Earth and Earth-616, as well as differing calendars in different realms, and damage to records during periods of massive warfare, have led to some inconsistency in the dating of the time periods of both Kang and Ravonna."

He wasn't \'supposed\' to be dead at all, and the fact that he had died was a glitch in the universe's makeup. But when Superboy-Prime hit the wall of his prison, the story corrected itself, and Jason, six months after the Joker murdered him, awoke in his coffin, still bruised and bleeding from the beating and explosion which had killed him. Using his belt buckle and bare hands, he managed to dig his way out and walk more than twelve miles away from the graveyard before being found by anyone. All he would say, and kept saying, was \'Bruce\'. Then the injuries to his skull and brain became too much, and he lapsed into a coma. He remained in a chronic vegetative state for a year. No record of his identity could be found. His body awoke in time, but not his mind. Running on instinct, Jason escaped Huntington Convalescent Home and sought refuge on the streets. Still bereft of reason and sense of self, he spent another year there, stealing food and sharing it with the other homeless people in the area. When he fought in the street with an angry homeless, a man recognised his style. Through the underworld network, Jason's whereabouts became known to Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia, who brought Jason to their home. A year later, Jason had regained the health he had lost living on the street. His abilities as a fighter remained, but nothing of his personality or ability to interact with the world was evident. Ra's, becoming frustrated with how much time Talia was spending on the boy, decided it was time for Jason to be sent elsewhere. Taking matters into her own hands, Talia shoved the unresponsive Jason into her father's Lazarus Pit, a rejuvenating pool which could restore life to bodies which were placed within it. It brought Jason's mind back. Fleeing Ra's' fury, Talia and Jason escaped to an oceanside clifftop. There, Talia warned Jason not to go to Bruce until Jason knew the truth -- that the Joker was still alive.

Xanadu can levitate objects, teleport herself, and banish minor demons. Madame Xanadu's parlour is full of magical books and objects, as well as jars containing the essences of malevolent entities. She rarely uses these objects of power, merely acting as a guardian of them. Madame Xanadu is an immortal, never aging and unable to be killed in any manner, thanks to her deal with Death.","She is blind currently in the DCU. In the Vertigo series, Madame Xanadu has much of her magical power taken away from her by Merlin. She is shown attempting to get her powers back by various means. Before besting Death and gaining virtual immortality, Madame Xanadu frequently had to drink a potion that rejuvenated her youth. Without it, she would become old and sickly within a matter of weeks.","Nimue Inwudu was the youngest sister of Vivienne (the Lady of the Lake) and Morgana Inwudu. The three grew up as Homo Magi and witnessed the dawn of mankind.  Nimue cared for homo sapiens as she did for all other species, but Morgana liked to toy with them and pull them toward their baser instincts. A bit of Morgana rubbed off on Nimue when she cast a spell of seduction on Merlin, in which she taught him his magic in exchange for sexual favors. Merlin had the last laugh, though, as he succeeded in stripping her magic away from her.  Shortly thereafter, Morgana, now styling herself Morgaine LeFay, conquered Camelot, and Merlin's demon, Etrigan, who was summoned to stop Morgana, was left to wander, as did Nimue, occasionally crossing paths with him. She fled to China and became an adviser in the court of Kublai Khan, trading sexual favors for her passage.  She left him, repulsed that he exiled his beloved Fourth Consort after she was raped. In 1493, sh arrived in Spain and fell in love with a beautiful young lady, Marisol de Rios, who was burned at the stake for sodomy by the Inquisition.  Nimue was not at home at the time of Marisol's capture, and was spared, but turned her back on Spain. She then went to France, where she was dubbed Madame de Xanadu for having come from Kublai Khan's palace.  She was a favorite of Marie Antoinette until a Tarot reading predicting the events of 1789. Denied access to her anti-aging potions while imprisoned in the Bastille, Madame Xanadu received a visit from Death, who was in an especially chipper mood, having just been at a party.  Madame Xanadu so amused Death with a creative interpretation of her own Tarot reading as involving living a long life, that Death declared that she would only take her if Nimue requested it, but left the anti-aging spells up to Nimue. She frequently crossed paths with the Phantom Stranger,.  She nearly fell in love with him, but ultimately found him too unfeeling, particularly after he stated that the French Revolution was an important step toward Kent Nelson's recovery of the Doctor Fate helmet and the necessity of the death of Mary Jane Kelly, who was Xanadu's friend (as were the other victims of Jack the Ripper, although she herself had long since abandoned prostitution), on the grounds that Jason Blood (Etrigan) had impregnanted her with a demonic child. Her desire for revenge on the Phantom Stranger over Mary's death inadvertently led to her causing Jim Corrigan to die and become the Spectre. She wandered for quite some time before deciding that she wanted to atone for her sins. She did so by helping those troubled with the supernatural. She has operated her fortune telling parlour out of Greenwich Village since the late 1930s. She however remained without any real magic might of her own, which has led her to manipulate various forces in order to gain power. Over the centuries Madame Xanadu developed herself as an advisor, and now Xanadu often meets clientele plagued by supernatural problems. Although she can advise them however, some force prevents her from directly interfering in solving their troubles. If one of her clients manages to conquer a supernatural force, she can contain that entity in jars within her fortune parlour to prevent it from causing any further trouble. When the Spectre was punished after his failures during the Crisis on Infinite Earths and the battle in Hell that soon followed, he and Jim Corrigan werre separated into two separate entities.  Madame Xanadu found Corrigan in an urn in a locker in Grand Central terminal and freed him.  She also found him an assistant in Kim Liang.  He then set up shop as a private investigator right above Xanadu's own shop.  She began an intimate relationship with the Spectre (she would undress and breathe him in as mist), although not Corrigan, who was having a chaste romance with Kim Liang."
9302,Manhunter Unit,,9302_20080415033934_char.jpg,,,"Androids created by the Guardians of the Universe. The Manhunters were the first attempt of the Guardians of the Universe to create an interstellar police force that would combat evil all over the cosmos. Their name and much of their code of behavior was modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the Manhunters of Ma'aleca'andra (Mars) millions of years ago (This creates an apparent chronology problem, since the Manhunters were created many millions of years ago, while the Green Martian race came into existence from the Burning Martians only about 20,000 years ago). For thousands of years, they served the Guardians well. However, the Manhunters became obsessed with the act of \'hunting\' criminals. Their code, \'No man escapes the Manhunters\' (corrupted from the original), became more important to them than seeing justice done Eventually, the robots conspired to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians defeated and destroyed most of them. Those that survived hid away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the Green Lantern Corps. The Manhunters infiltrated and liberated many planets disguised as living beings and created a \'Cult of the Manhunters\' that trained others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world started a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erected a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters' agents were unaware that their masters were robots, or that their real purposes were not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes also known as Manhunters. They wore red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. The Manhunters were discovered by the Justice League who seemingly defeated the Manhunter's leader, the Grandmaster. One of their human pawns, Mark Shaw, adopted a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer. However, he was later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero. Years later, it was revealed that the Manhunters not only still existed, but had infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even managed to infiltrate the Olympian Gods, one of their number posing as the goat god Pan, as shown during the Challenge of the Gods storyline. They revealed themselves when a Guardian and a member of the Zamarons tried to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what became known as the Millennium crisis. On this occasion, there was a massive counter strike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seemed that the Grandmaster had finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopted his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself Kyle Rayner encountered the Manhunters not long after Hal Jordan's destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on Oa. The first of which encountered a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and was almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle used his wits to outsmart and decapitate it. The next time, multiple Manhunters appeared. They were all sentient, individuals, and captured Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They failed and Kyle managed to escape. When the Manhunters were replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreated to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, came to Biot and became the Manhunters' new Grandmaster. He used his mastery over machinery and Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of Parallax). Henshaw decided not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner The Manhunters resurfaced as part of the Sinestro Corps. They carried miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which were used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings. In a revision of Hal Jordan's beginnings, it was revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It was eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by Krona to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force."

2042,Growing Man (Marvel),,2042_20071201112904_char.jpg,"The Growing Man is a stimuloid — a form of android that absorbs most forms of kinetic energy directed against it, which in theory renders it impervious to physical harm. The absorption of the energy stimulates the rapid multiplication of the stimuloid's artificial cells, causing it to grow significantly in size with a proportionate increase in strength and resistance to damage. It is assumed that in order to grow the stimuloid draws its additional mass from an extra-dimensional source. The Growing Man's original size is that of a child's doll, but it can achieve the height of a building ten stories tall. Kang is also capable of using an unknown form of energy that causes the Growing Man to revert to its original size. The Growing Man's circuitry appears to have limits, however, as both Thor and Hercules are able to disorient and damage the android with a series of super-strong blows",,"The Growing Man was originally built by an alien race on behalf of the time-traveling villain known as Kang the Conqueror, who had subjugated their planet, Kosmos. Knowing that the android would be used as a weapon in the past, the scientists of Kosmos build a device into the android which would deliver a warning message to their ancestors to prepare for Kang's coming. For some unknown reason, however, the warning beacon does not activate. The Growing Man first appears on Earth as an inert doll-sized figure found by New York police. The android reactivates soon after and battles the Thunder God Thor, before being deactivated and recovered by Kang. Months later, Kang uses the Growing Man to abduct Tony Stark - the alter-ego of Iron Man - from a hospital. The Avengers attack and follow the Growing Man into the future, where they become involved in his competition against the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster. The alien colonizers of Rigel eventually find the Growing Man in one of Kang's abandoned vessels and send it back to Earth to use it against Iron Man, who eventually defeats the android by overloading its circuitry.  Kang later revives the Growing Man and directs it against New York City, although Mister Fantastic devises a means of reversing the growing process, causing the android to shrink from sight. The Growing Man was later recovered by the subversive organization HYDRA, led by terrorist Baron Strucker. Strucker orders the Growing Man to attack New York as part of a ploy to destroy the formative team the Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolts, however, not only defeat the android but also manage to activate the warning beacon. Kang later dispatched a new variation of the Growing Man against the superhero team the Young Avengers in an attempt to track his younger self, who had retreated to the past and was now posing as Iron Lad. This Growing Man collapsed and split into multiple, smaller units when struck."

However, when his brother, David, was killed in action shortly after taking on the role of Starman, Jack was forced into taking up the cosmic rod in order to protect Opal City and bring his brother's killer to justice. Since then, he imperceptibly came to love his role as Opal's protector, and found that he enjoyed being a hero. Recently, he embarked on a year-long quest in space to find Will Payton, his girlfriend Sadie's brother and a former Starman. He was eventually successful in his quest, but did not bring Payton back to Earth since the latter discovered he may be the reincarnation of an alien prince. Jack agreed to be a member of the Justice Society after the mission to ensure Fate's reincarnation, but following events in Opal City which kept him away for some time, he reconsidered and become a reservist, called in when the group was in desperate need of additional firepower. Later still, following the death of his father, and Sadie's announcement that she was pregnant, he decided to step down from the heroic world altogether in order to rear his two children (the first having been sired without his knowledge when he was raped by the Mist), passing the cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, the current Star-Spangled Kid."

291,Captain Atom (DC)(Post Crisis),Nathaniel  Christopher Adam,291_20051216195022_char.jpg,"Nearly indestructible metal alloy skin, energy blasts from hands, flight, super strength, ability to absorb energy, time travel (only forward and only when he absorbs too much energy), and rapid healing.",The X-Ionizer,"Superficially, there are two different Captains Atom (the Silver/Bronze Age Captain Atom from Charlton Comics and the Modern Age Captain Atom from DC Comics).  Recent events, however, allow for the interpretation that they are, in fact, the same character--from a certain point of view. Pre- Crisis The first Captain Atom, created by Steve Ditko at Charlton, was Captain Allen Adam, a straight-arrow, pre-Vietnam cold warrior in the US Air Force.  While testing a new missile for the AIr Force,  he got caught up in its nuclear explosion in space.  This disintegrated, then somehow reintegrated him, giving him access to the \'raw\' power of atomic energy. This character did briefly appear in the pre- Crisis DCU, soon after the sale of Charlton characters was final.  Some effort was taken at establishing the \'Ditko Captain Atom\', \'Ditko Blue Beetle\', and the rest of the Charlton comics characters as being present on a the new \'Earth 4\'--when the Crisis hit and made the point moot.  (Indeed, this fact was actually established in the series, Crisis on Infinite Earths .  Talk about coming to the multiverse party late...) Post- Crisis The second Captain Atom was named Nathaniel Christopher Adam.  He was, at first, wholly different than the \'Ditko Atom\'.   Convicted of a crime he didn't commit, and to avoid life imprisonment in a United States Army prison, he volunteered to work for Wade Eiling and Heinrich Megala's Captain Atom Project. This let to Nate being bonded to a living alien metal from the Silver Shield (with a little help from an atomic explosion), and being catapulted from May, 1968 to the modern day. Found by Eiling and Megala, they crafted the super-hero identity for the captain, as well as his new, but short-lived, alter ego of Cameron Scott, attempting to gain information for the United States on the various meta-humans proliferating the landscape. Captain Atom became a member of the Justice League International, formed an attachment to Nightshade, led the forces of Earth in the Invasion!, became leader of Justice League Europe, and eventually found the man who had framed him for the original crime, and revealed the truth behind the \'big lie\' to the world, before being lost in time thanks to the efforts of Monarch. Captain Atom did eventually return to our time, where he led the Extreme Justice branch of the Justice League, until the time of Earth's Final Night, but Nate is still a semi-active super-hero, having recently worked with the L.A.W., free of the guilt of his crime and his original duplicity in joining the Justice League. This Captain Atom has an odd reaction to exposure to large amounts of energy.  He will seem to be killed, or atomized, by it--but instead is displaced by it.  Typically this displacement takes the form of time travel, neatly allowing him to \'disappear\' from the DCU time-line for a while, only to return when the writers find convenient.  He also has the ability to shift dimensionally in such explosive situations.  Recently, he has been shown to cross over from the regular DCU to the Wildstorm universe, using this unique power. How, then, is this character related to the first Captain Atom?  As a part of his initial \'cover story\'--necessary to keep the \'Captain Atom Project\' a secret-- all of the adventures of the \'Ditko Captain Atom\' were assigned to this Captain Atom by the US Military.  Thus, if you were to pull his file at the Pentagon, you would see the events of Captain Allen Adam's life in Captain Nathaniel Christopher Adam's records."

He possesses the agility of a great ape and the acrobatic prowess of an accomplished circus aerialist. His physiology is durable enough to allow him to survive a three story fall by landing on his feet without suffering any broken bones or sprains. The Beast's legs are powerful enough to enable him to leap approximately 15 feet high in a standing high jump, and around 25 feet in a standing broad jump. He can also run on all fours at approximately 40 miles per hour for short sprints. The Beast can crawl up brick walls by wedging his fingers and toes into the smallest cracks and applying a vice-like grip on them, as well as walk a tightrope with minimal effort. He is adept in performing complicated sequences of gymnastics such as flips, rolls, and springs, and can also walk on his hands for many hours. Further, his manual and pedial dexterity are so great that he can perform multiple tasks such as writing with both hands at once or tie knots in rope with his toes. The Beast possesses enhanced senses, the ability to secrete pheromones to attract members of the opposite sex, as well as a slight healing factor that allows him to regenerate minor wounds and recover quickly from minor ailments such as colds. The Beast also possesses cat-like night vision as well as razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet.",,"While working at a nuclear power plant, Norton McCoy was exposed to massive amounts of radiation that affected his genes. As a result, Norton's son, Henry \'Hank\' McCoy, was born a mutant who showed the signs of his being different from birth with his unusually large hands and feet. As a youth, Hank's freakish appearance was the subject of much ridicule from his classmates, earning him the nickname of \'beast\'. However, one classmate named Jennifer came to know the real Hank after he began tutoring her in biology. On the night of the junior prom, Jennifer insisted that Hank accompany her as her date, and stood up for him after he was teased. In his senior year, Hank's superhuman agility and athletic prowess earned him recognition as a star football player. During one game, Hank easily stopped a trio of robbers who were attempting to escape across the football field. His efforts were noticed by the villain named the Conquistador who kidnapped Hank's parents in an effort to coerce the young mutant into working for him. The X-Men soon arrived and defeated the villain, and Hank was invited by Professor Charles Xavier to join the team of teenage mutant heroes and enroll in the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Unable to resist the temptation of a private institution that could offer him limitless academic opportunities, Hank accepted. A brilliant student, Hank completed his doctoral studies under Xavier's tutelage, and finally graduated from the Xavier School to take a position at the Brand Corporation as a genetic researcher under Doctor Carl Maddicks. During one of his experiments, Hank discovered the hormonal extract that causes genetic mutation and went to inform Maddicks of his findings. However, Maddicks was secretly plotting to steal top secret government documents, and Hank took it upon himself to stop Maddicks. In order to disguise his appearance, Hank took the extract and underwent radical physical changes that enhanced his agility and strength, as well as causing him to grow fangs, pointed ears, and fur all over his body. When he stayed too long in this state, Hank found he could not return to his original form. He was now a beast in fact as well as in name. At first, he tried to hide his mutation with a latex mask and gloves, but later learned to accept his new appearance. After receiving his doctorate in genetics and being considered one of the world's experts on mutations and evolutionary human biology, despite never having earned a Nobel Prize or been invited to join the National Academy of Sciences, Hank left Brand and applied to join the ranks of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers. Initially accepted as a probationary member, Hank soon proved his worth and was granted full membership. During his time with the team he revealed his identity to the public in the hope that his status as an Avenger would help ease human/mutant tensions. Following a restructuring of the Avengers, Hank left and became involved with the team of adventurers known as the Defenders which he soon reorganized into a more formal and cohesive unit, bringing in his former X-Men teammates Iceman and Archangel. Following the apparent death of several of the Defenders, Hank reunited with the other four original X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting them down. Shortly after the formation of X-Factor, Hank was captured by Maddicks who sought to experiment on Hank in an attempt to find a \'cure\' for his son's own mutancy. However, the serum Hank was given caused him to revert to his original human appearance. Soon after, Hank first met television anchorwoman Trish Tilby, who was investigating X-Factor. During an attack on New York by the eternal mutant Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen, Hank was stricken with a virus that sapped his intellect and increased his strength every time he exerted himself physically. The more Hank used his strength, the stronger he got, but the less intelligent he became. Finally, to save his friend Iceman from the deadly kiss of the mutant named Infectia, Hank intervened and was himself affected, the result of which returned him to his blue-furred form and restored his intellect. Soon after, Hank and Trish began seeing each other romantically, however her work often intruded on their relationship and the pair ultimately called it off. After X-Factor disbanded, Hank returned to the ranks of the X-Men and became the team's resident technological and medical genius, working on everything from advanced alien technology to the deadly mutant-killing Legacy Virus. Hank also continued his on/off relationship with Trish until she released information on the Virus to the public, which caused hysteria that culminated in the beating to death of a young mutant. During this tenure with the X-Men, Hank was lured into a trap and replaced in the ranks of the X-Men by the Dark Beast, an alternate-reality version of himself. Sealed behind a brick wall, Hank was nearly about to give up and let fate win when his water tube broke and spurted, revealing the grooves of a trap door in his cell. Energized by hope, Hank broke his restraints and escaped with the aid of the new government-sponsored X-Factor team. Hank returned to the X-Men, and soon after met with Trish to apologize for his previous harsh treatment of her. She forgave him and the pair renewed their relationship. Hank eventually took an extended leave of absence from the X-Men to work on a cure for the Legacy Virus, which he ultimately found thanks to his implementing the work of his former colleague, the late Moira MacTaggert. Soon after, Hank joined Storm's team of X-Treme X-Men in their quest for the diaries of the late mutant seer Destiny. Almost killed in the team's first battle with the villainous Vargas, Hank's life was saved by his teammate Tessa who used a heretofore-unseen power to accelerate the Beast's mutation to a new level. Hank returned to Xavier's mansion to recuperate and mutated further, becoming bulkier, heavier, and taking on a more leonine appearance. Forced to relearn fine motor control over his body, Hank once again served as the team's resident genius, as well as an active teacher of dozens of young mutants at the renamed Xavier Institute of Higher Learning. Unable to deal with his latest mutation, Trish called Hank and ended their relationship over the phone. Soon after, Hank was beaten into a coma by a student possessed by Professor Xavier's malevolent twin Cassandra Nova, who herself had possessed Xavier's body. Hank recovered in time to expose her plans and Cassandra was ultimately defeated, but not before she had exposed her brother Charles to the world as a mutant, forever changing life at the Xavier mansion for the X-Men."

Investigating, Buddy found himself bathed in a unique radiation which altered his body forever. When animals from a nearby zoo escaped, Buddy discovered, much to his pleasure that whenever he was near any animal, he somehow absorbed its special abilities. After several short adventures, Buddy decided to fashion himself a special costume and began using the name Animal Man (or A-Man) whenever he used his powers in public. Time after time Buddy's abilities came in handy in solving one problem or another, and although he did not originally intend to use his animal-adapting powers to fight crime, he nevertheless was repeatedly drawn into battle. Buddy later married Ellen Frazier and retired his Animal-Man identity for several years, while continuing to work in the movies. Buddy and Ellen now have two children, Cliff and Maxine, and to date neither has shown any latent powers of their own. Recently, Buddy was found by a mysterious being who called himself only the Immortal Man. He once again donned his Animal-Man uniform and joined the stranger and several other semiretired adventurers in an organization called the Forgotten Heroes."

Le Bon Gumbo, also known as Swamp Thing, formerly known as Alex Olsen, had recently retired to the Parliament of Trees, and the Earth was trying to form an Earth Elemental.  While it eventually found one in German pilot Albert Höllerer, it failed in this attempt, because fire was not present, and a white zombie-like creature emerged built over Gold's remains with fragmentary memories, including an ability to speak English at a below-average level.  He stole the prison garb of two escaped convicts, then was asked to lead a band of criminals who noticed that he could stand in their campfire without being burned. One of them called him Solomon Grundy when he said that he was \'born on Monday\' like in the Mother Goose rhyme.  He led the group through several heists, and Green Lantern Alan Scott's ring would not work against him, so he didn't understand why the criminals cared about Green Lantern.  They instructed him to kill Green Lantern by throwing him off a terrace.  When he did so, there was a large green and yellow explosion.  He then grabbed a member of his gang, Jake, and threw him to the floor.  The rest of the gang told him that you should only kill enemies, but Jake was already dead, which Grundy did not understand because of the lack of flashes. After Green Lantern, whose ring would not work against Grundy because of his plant composition, pushed him in front of a train, he has consistently sought revenge against Green Lantern, and has been amoral enough to harm others who have gotten in his way.  Eventually, Green Lanterns Alan Scott and Hal Jordan sent him to the moon, where he had what was described as \'his first independent thought,\' traveling to Earth-1, believing that he may have an equivalent there who would be his friend. His body was fragmented and sent to Earth-1, where it battled Superman, even as Swamp Thing Alec Holland attempted to save him, but Swamp Thing was still experiencing too much pain in speaking to communicate with Superman why he thought Grundy should be saved.  These duplicates were destroyed with a formula created by S.T.A.R. Labs. When Solomon Grundy learned of Scott's children, Jade and Obsidian, he attempted to kill them, but Jade showed him kindness, and he was willing to obey her, although he became subject to wicked forces and eventually conquered their team, Infinity, Inc. When Lex Luthor sent Swamp Thing reeling into Space, the Parliament of Trees assumed that he was dead and tried to put a new Swamp Thing, known as the Sprout, into Grundy's body.  When Swamp Thing returned, he was relieved that Grundy was not dead, but Grundy had no memory of him, and they fought.  Swamp Thing found Grundy too corrupt to be Earth's Elemental, and prevented the Sprout from assimilating with him."

The computer in his costume could calculate anything, anticipate any attack, and conclude how to strike at opponents. However, the Calculator had to encounter his opponent at least once before having sufficient info to use. Calculator first made a name attacking members of the JLA – Atom, Black Canary, Green Arrow, Elongated Man, and Hawkman.

It would be hard to overstate her importance to the superhero genre, but it would be relatively simple to mistakenly think that like Superman and Batman, she's been seen monthly since the Golden Age. There have, in fact, been several \'gaps\' in her publication history, the most significant of which was virtually the whole of the 1950s. She was one of the principle heroes targeted by the Congressional investigation into comic book morality--for lack of the official name. Though most modern observers would find the early 50s criticisms of her patently absurd, the charges stuck, and the superhero genre nearly died amidst talk of Wonder Woman's unhealthy obsession with bondage, lesbianism and inappropriate independence from men. As events have transpired in the DCU since the 1950s, most all of her wartime appearances have been officially retconned, and her initial membership in the Justice Society has now been retroactively ascribed to her mother, Hippolyta. Thus, even though we might see Diana appearing for the first time in All-Star Comics #8, DC would like us to believe, now, that all of her appearances in the original JSA run in fact happened to her mother, Hippolyta. Consequently her \'first appearance\' is now quite confusing, because Diana is shown to be the one clearly appearing \'as Wonder Woman\', and Hippolyta is clearly shown to be there simply as Queen and mother of Diana. Oddly enough, the first appearance of Wonder Woman must now be retconned completely out of existence in the post-CRISIS world. For these reasons, this character included so you don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure out things \'from a post-Crisis perspective\'. If the story happened since the February 1987 Pérez reboot following Crisis on Infinite Earths , use this character."

To improve his timing he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career. He then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials). Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom. He next tried to steal a collection of historic Hungarian clocks, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos's weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions -- lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), and ultimately a fully functional time machine (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggested that Chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from. Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group a six-inch tall aliens in the Amazonian jungle. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during Darkseid's anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost Captain Atom. Upon his return to the present Chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune, but old habits die hard, and Chronos's illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the Calendar Man to work with the Time Foes, but was captured by the Team Titans. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance -- he accepted an offer from the demon Neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to travel through time. However bargains with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his ageing. A man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen. All the experiments and Neron's \'gift\' had taken a toll on Clinton's body and be began to loose touch with any sense of the \'now.\' He had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness. His disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into \'The Void\' of time. A funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second Chronos (Walker Gabriel). This entry uses material derived in whole or in part from wikipedia.org ."

257,Captain Marvel (DC)(Post Crisis),Billy Batson,257_20051112034940_char.jpg,The abilities of Captain Marvel are summed up in his magic word.,"Cap can get a bit nervous around forward women. He's also a mere mortal in his Billy Batson identity, and can be hurt or killed like anybody else (unless he can get the magic lightning to strike in time).","Alone and on the streets of a major metropolitan city, orphaned newsboy Billy Batson was led into an abandoned subway tunnel by a mysterious stranger. On an out-of-service rail-track an odd and driverless subway car stopped to pick-up Billy and his companion. Following a brief trip, Billy and the stranger disembarked the train and walked down a ancient hallway. On one side of the cavernous hall grotesque statues of the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness and Injustice loomed. As mysteriously as he appeared the stranger vanishes. Sitting on a throne at the far-end of the hall is a wizened old man with long white hair and a full, almost floor-length white beard. At the old man’s beckoning, Billy steps forward and stops in front of the throne. The old man announces himself by proclaiming, \'I am Shazam!,\' amid a peal of thunder and flash of lightning. As the smoke clears Billy notices the wall behind the wizard is inscribed with the names of six great elders which together form the name SHAZAM: Solomon- wisdom, Hercules - strength, Atlas - stamina, Zeus - power, Achilles - Courage, and Mercury - speed. Shazam relates to the young boy that he needs a new champion to battle evil and that he has chosen Billy. \'Speak my name\' shouts Shazam! As Billy shouts the name of the ancient wizard, lightning drops from the ceiling of the chamber striking him, while at the same time a deafening peal of thunder echoes off the cavern walls. As the smoke clears, Billy discovers that he has been transformed into a man! \'Captain Marvel, I salute you,\' says Shazam! At that moment a slab of stone hanging above Shazam’s head, held in place by a tattered thread, crashes down onto the old wizard crushing him. From the dust and rumble a ghostly image of Shazam appears and lights a nearby brazier. At that, Captain Marvel sets off to track down the evil radio silencer plaguing his fair city — and at that Captain Marvel meets his arch-nemesis for the first time: Dr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana!"

67,Iceman (Marvel),Robert Louis 'Bobby' Drake,67_20060308113659_char.jpg,"Iceman is able to lower his external and internal body temperature without harm to himself, thereby radiating intense cold from his body. Iceman is able to reach -105 degrees Fahrenheit within a few seconds, and is immune to sub-zero temperatures around him. In addition, Iceman can freeze any moisture in the air around him into unusually hard ice, and thereby form simple objects such as slides, ladders, shields, and bats. Iceman can also augment his ice form with extraneous moisture to enhance his strength and durability, and can reshape his body's ice form at will by using any available moisture from his surrounding environment. Similarly, Iceman can rebuild his ice form if any part of it is broken or if it is shattered completely without suffering any permanent damage. Previously, Iceman was able to transform his body into solid ice and back to human form at will. Recently, however, his body has since permanently transformed into solid ice as a result of a secondary mutation. Iceman also possesses the potential to transport himself quickly over great distances through nearby flows of water by merging his body’s molecules with those of the stream.",,"Bobby Drake discovered his mutant power to create ice while in his early teens, yet kept his condition hidden from everyone but his parents. Initially, Bobby was unable to stop feeling cold and shivering, but soon managed to keep it under control. When a bully named Rocky Beasely and his friends attacked Bobby and his then-girlfriend, Judy Harmon, the youngster panicked. To save Harmon, Bobby temporarily encased Rocky in ice, thus revealing his abilities for all to see. Believing the boy to be a menace, the townspeople organized a lynch mob. They broke into Bobby's home and overpowered him, but the local sheriff took the teenager into custody for his own protection. Meanwhile, the situation had come to the attention of Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic mentor of the team of teenage mutant super heroes the X-Men. Professor X dispatched his first X-Man, Cyclops, to contact Bobby. Cyclops stole into the jailhouse as planned, but the two began fighting when Bobby refused to accompany him. Caught by the lynch mob, Cyclops and Bobby were about to be hanged when they broke free. Professor X used his mental powers to halt the townspeople in their tracks and erase their memories of Bobby's powers. A grateful Bobby then accepted Xavier's invitation to enroll at his School for Gifted Youngsters and took the codename Iceman. Though initially manifesting as a snow-like form, Bobby soon learned to increase his degree of cold control resulting in an ice-like, almost transparent form. Hated and feared by humanity, the X-Men honed their amazing abilities while standing in defense of a world pushed to the brink of genetic war by a handful of mutant terrorists. Iceman, the team's youngest founding member, became known as the comedian of the group. Regardless, he pulled his weight and worked well with rest of the team. Following a short break-up after believing their mentor was dead, the X-Men reformed with two new members - the magnetism-manipulating Polaris and the plasma-charged Havok. Bobby had a brief romantic relationship with Polaris until she realized that her heart belonged to Havok. Bobby had trouble accepting her decision, which led to increased tension between himself and Havok. Eventually, Bobby quit the team for a short time to sort out his feelings. Later, when the sentient island-being known as Krakoa took Bobby and his team mates captive, Professor X assembled a second team of X-Men to rescue them. Soon after, most of the founding members left the team and Bobby began attending college on a scholarship. Eventually, he helped his former team mate Angel form the Champions of Los Angeles. When the Champions disbanded, Bobby went missing, and Angel teamed up with the costumed adventurer Spider-Man to find him. Bobby had been hypnotized by the Champions' enemy Rampage into donning his battle suit, and Angel and Spider-Man were forced to battle him. After Rampage was defeated, Bobby quit his life as a costumed adventurer and returned to college full time to study accounting. Later, Bobby was contacted by Professor X to assist in rescuing friends and family of the X-Men from the assassin known as Arcade. Along with other former X-Men Banshee, Polaris, and Havok, the ad-hoc team managed to free the hostages and Bobby finally came to accept Polaris' love for Havok. During a summer break from college Bobby went to visit his former X-Men teammate Beast and soon became involved with the loose-knit collection of costumed heroes known as the Defenders. Along with Beast and Angel, Bobby helped reorganize the team into a more formal and cohesive unit. The Defenders eventually disbanded when several of their members appeared to perish during a climactic battle. Soon after, Bobby joined the other founding X-Men to form X-Factor, an organization that intended to seek out and aid other mutants under the pretense of hunting down those perceived menaces to society. During his time with the team, the Asgardian trickster god Loki captured Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhanced Bobby's powers to such an extent that he was forced to wear a power-dampening belt that was originally created by the subversive organization known as The Right to cancel out his powers. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby found he could encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gained sufficient control over his augmented powers that he was able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he had achieved his full potential, Bobby never attempted to push himself beyond his perceived limits. When Professor Xavier returned to Earth following an extended absence in outer space, Bobby and the other members of X-Factor rejoined the X-Men. Shortly thereafter, Bobby confronted former Cosmonaut Mikhail Rasputin, the reality-warping mutant brother of Bobby’s steel-skinned teammate Colossus. Rasputin forced Bobby into a form composed entirely of ice, affording the young mutant a glimpse into his true nature. Subsequently, Bobby began experimenting with his abilities - using ice to add mass to his slight frame, or lift himself high into the air without the benefit of his usual slides. Months later, the psychically incapacitated mutant telepath Emma Frost took mental possession of Bobby's body. Frost was able to activate the full extent of his powers, using his powers in ways Bobby had not thought possible until she was coaxed back into her own body by Professor X. With Frost's prodding, Iceman later learned to completely transform his body into its full ice state on his own. Frost later also showed Bobby that he could safely revert back to his human form after his ice form's chest had been shattered in battle. Bobby later took a leave of absence from the X-Men to spend more time with his father who had been injured by the grass roots anti-mutant movement the Friends of Humanity. He returned briefly to the X-Men to rescue mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes during the government-sponsored anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance, after which he returned to his father's side. Two subsequent events served to shed further light on Iceman's untapped potential. To secure a new host body, the would-be conqueror Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of \'The Twelve\' - mutants of incredible power, destined to alter the course of human history. Among their number was Iceman, who survived the ordeal thanks only to the apparent sacrifice of Cyclops. A second defining event occurred when the sentient spaceship Prosh escaped the confines of a Celestial prison, returned to Earth and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Their mission: Save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the Stranger, who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants. These experiences forced Iceman into the realization that he no longer need fear the evolution of his abilities, and he returned to the X-Men to explore his mutant powers to the fullest. After suffering a chest injury, Bobby was unable to prevent his body from transforming into solid ice due to the manifestation of a secondary mutation. After the House of M incident Iceman was believed to be among the mutants who lost their powers, but this apparent loss of powers was quickly revealed to be a subconscious reaction to the trauma of that reality warp. Since recovering his powers, his ice form has taken on a much more jagged appearance. Recently, Iceman has been using his powers in innovative ways, including the ability to exist as a sentient gas. He discovered this ability while fighting the Children of the Vault when they attacked the Mansion. After the fight with the Children, he joined Rogue's team of X-Men. [At an unspecified time, all five original adolescent X-Men had been plucked from their timeline and transferred to the future to interact with their adult selves.  During this event young Jean revealed to young Bobby that her telepathic abilities had discovered that he is gay (All New X-Men #40).]"

After Rose and Logan arrived at the Alberta mining camp (where they were taking refuge after fleeing Logan's childhood home), Logan soon met Cookie Malone, an overweight cook who was being accused of keeping extra rations for himself while leaving the rest of the camp hungry.  These accusations of selfishness became apparently well-founded when,  in two different points of the series, he is shown to be robbing people's homes. Logan first ran into Cookie as a teenager.  Logan was having trouble handling a cart full of stone after its wheel hit a bump in the downhill road he was on.  Cookie ran up the hill to help him, only to turn on him and dump the stones over the side of the hill.  Logan and Cookie would have more confrontations, with Cookie bullying a submissive Logan. Eventually, Logan became very popular at the camp and Cookie was jealous of the attention.  To get back at Logan, he cut the dynamite fuses short.  This resulted in the tragic deaths of some workers, not including Logan.  Logan was trapped under the rubble, but survived due to his healing factor.  During the funeral for the workers who weren't as fortunate as Logan, the Canucklehead himself caught Cookie robbing a home in the camp.  This was the first time Logan was violent towards Cookie, and from here the tables turned. At the end of the Origin series, there is a cage fight tournament at the local pub and both Cookie and Logan enter.  They meet each other in the semi-finals and, aided by a crooked gambler, Cookie opens the bout with a metal-knuckled punch to Logan's head.  Cookie taunted Logan and was then beaten relentlessly, with Logan only barely sparing Cookie's life."

Under the leadership of SDC's founder Howard Stark, Nero and Si Ma were instrumental in creating a bacterial body sheathe that would render an individual impervious to most conventional forms of injury. Nero often volunteered to test the bio-armor's capabilities. Howard Stark lost controlling interest in Stark Defense Corporation to his rival Zebediah Stane, but fortunately, he had no legal ownership over projects designed by Bio-Armor. Frustrated beyond measure, Zebediah Stane was determined to learn the secrets behind Stark's armor coating. He sent some men to track down and abduct Nero, bringing him back to an undisclosed facility. Stane applied one of his own inventions, a mind-reading skullcap called the Lid, to Nero's head. The machine violently ripped all information concerning the bio-armor's designs from Nero's mind, leaving him insensate. Nero survived the experience, but his intellect was reduced to that of a toddler. Stane still had some mental control over Nero however. When he learned that Howard Stark used the bio-armor to save the life of his son Antonio, he tried to mind-control the addle-brained Nero into abducting the child for him. Nero resisted the mental summons long enough to scribble out a warning to Howard Stark. To prevent Stane from gaining complete control over him, Nero killed himself by stabbing himself in the ear with a pencil until it pierced his brain."

Unlike the true cesta, which is designed to catch and hurl a hard rubber ball, Overthrow's own metallic cesta generates glowing balls of explosive energy which he can hurl over great distances with pinpoint accuracy.  When not in use, Overthrow's cesta flips back to become part of his gauntlet.",,"Arnold Beck was an embittered employee let go from Kord Omniversal (the corporation run by Ted Kord, the Blue Beetle) who came to believe that he was just a victim of the machinations of the military-industrial complex, of which Kord's company was a prime element. He acquired a power-suit of armor, and a stylized weapon resembling a cesta-punta used in the game of jai alai which hurled explosives, and set about to demolish Kord's main facilities; this naturally brought him into conflict with the Blue Beetle, who handily defeated him. During the Millennium Affair, which saw a Guardian of the Universe and a Zamaron journey to Earth to help ten human beings become agents of evolutionary change, the intergalactic group known as the Manhunters threw all of its efforts into ending their program and neutralizing Earth's heroes from providing any assistance. Dozens of heroes found themselves confronted by loved ones, friends, employees, and allies who revealed themselves to be secret Manhunters who had reported back to their superiors over the years on their target's activities. Unusually, no such act of betrayal had struck the Blue Beetle, and he began to vigorously seek out just who \'his\' Manhunter might be. He at first suspected that a corrupt Hub City police captain who had been blackmailing him with the knowledge of his secret identity was the Manhunter assigned to him, but this turned out to be merely a coincidental act; the Beetle was then confronted by Overthrow, who revealed himself to be the Manhunter assigned to report on him and neutralize him, if necessary. It had been the Manhunters who had provided Beck with his armor and helped him create the Overthrow identity, and on their orders he had attempted to contain and impede the Blue Beetle's activities. Beetle once again defeated Overthrow, however, and after the complete and utter defeat of Earth's Manhunters by the combined heroes of Earth (in which battle Overthrow also fought on the Manhunters' behalf) he disappeared. Overthrow was for some time living in the \'supervillain\' nation of Zandia, the former desmesne of Brother Blood's Church of Blood. Overthrow was part of Zandia's Olympic team, which was made up largely of supervillains. During the events of the OMAC Project, Overthrow was in Moscow battling Rocket Red Dimitri Pushkin, the former JLI/JLE member. (Pushkin's predecessor in the JLI, Rocket Red #7 Vladimir Mikoyan, had been one of Beck's fellow Manhunters, who had revealed himself to the League and was destroyed in battle with them.) He was then targeted by the new head of Checkmate, Maxwell Lord. Lord dispatched an OMAC to attack Overthrow, and the cyborg swiftly cut the supervillain down, killing him."
